	abstract = {This paper is the outcome of a community initiative to identify major unsolved scientific problems in hydrology motivated by a need for stronger harmonisation of research efforts. The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries. In particular, the expansion of the human footprint raises a new set of questions related to human interactions with nature and water cycle feedbacks in the context of complex water management problems. We hope that this reflection and synthesis of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology will help guide research efforts for some years to come.},

This paper presents the Modular Assessment of Rainfall-Runoff Models Toolbox (MARRMoT): a modular open-source toolbox containing documentation and model code for 46 existing conceptual hydrologic models. The toolbox is developed in Matlab and works with Octave. Models are implemented following several best practices: definition of model equations (the mathematical model) is kept separate from the numerical methods used to solve these equations (the numerical model) to generate clean code that is easy to adjust and debug; the Implicit Euler time-stepping scheme is provided as the default option to numerically approximate each model's Ordinary Differential Equations in a more robust way than (common) Explicit schemes would; threshold equations are smoothed to avoid discontinuities in the model's objective function space; and the model equations are solved simultaneously, avoiding physically unrealistic sequential solving of fluxes. Generalized parameter ranges are provided to assist with model inter-comparison studies. In addition to this paper and its Supporting Materials, a User Manual is provided together with several workflow scripts that show basic example applications of the toolbox. The toolbox and documentation are available from https://github.com/wknoben/MARRMoT (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2482542). Our main scientific objective in developing this toolbox is to facilitate the inter-comparison of conceptual hydrological model structures which are in widespread use, in order to ultimately reduce the uncertainty in model structure selection.},

Identifying the underlying causes is challenging, and thus, solving the problem remains difficult. To better understand the reasons for the leaky pipeline, we assess the perceptions and impacts of gender bias and imbalance—two major drivers of the leakage—at different academic career levels with an anonymous survey in geoscience academia (n=1,220). The survey results show that both genders view male geoscientists as substantially more gender biased than female scientists. Moreover, female geoscientists are more than twice as likely to experience negative gender bias at their workplaces and scientific organizations compared to male geoscientists. There are also pronounced gender differences regarding (i) the relevance of role models, (ii) family-friendly working conditions, and (iii) the approval of gender quotas for academic positions. Given the male dominance in senior career levels, our results emphasize that those feeling less impacted by the negative consequences of gender bias and imbalance are the ones in position to tackle the problem. We thus call for actions to better address gender biases and to ensure a balanced gender representation at decision-making levels to ultimately retain more women in geoscience academia.},

            The intent of this paper is to encourage improved numerical implementation of land models. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a unified framework to formulate and implement land model equations. We separate the representation of physical processes from their numerical solution, enabling the use of established robust numerical methods to solve the model equations. Second, we introduce a set of synthetic test cases (the laugh tests) to evaluate the numerical implementation of land models. The test cases include storage and transmission of water in soils, lateral sub-surface flow, coupled hydrological and thermodynamic processes in snow, and cryosuction processes in soil. We consider synthetic test cases as “laugh tests” for land models because they provide the most rudimentary test of model capabilities. The laugh tests presented in this paper are all solved with the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives model (SUMMA) implemented using the SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/Algebraic equation Solvers (SUNDIALS). The numerical simulations from SUMMA/SUNDIALS are compared against (1) solutions to the synthetic test cases from other models documented in the peer-reviewed literature; (2) analytical solutions; and (3) observations made in laboratory experiments. In all cases, the numerical simulations are similar to the benchmarks, building confidence in the numerical model implementation. We posit that some land models may have difficulty in solving these benchmark problems. Dedicating more effort to solving synthetic test cases is critical in order to build confidence in the numerical implementation of land models.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Estimating the impact of different sources of uncertainty along the modelling chain is an important skill graduates are expected to have. Broadly speaking, educators can cover uncertainty in hydrological modelling by differentiating uncertainty in data, model parameters and model structure. This provides students with insight on the impact of uncertainties on modelling results and thus on the usability of the acquired model simulations for decision making. A survey among teachers in the earth and environmental sciences showed that model structural uncertainty is the least represented uncertainty group in teaching. This paper introduces a teaching module that introduces students to the basics of model structure uncertainty through two ready-to-use exercises. The module is short and can easily be integrated into an existing hydrologic curriculum, limiting the time investment needed to teach this aspect of modelling uncertainty. A trial application at the Technische Universität Dresden (Germany) showed that the exercises can be completed in less than two afternoons and that the provided setup effectively transfers the intended insights about model structure uncertainty. The module requires either Matlab or Octave, and uses the open-source Modular Assessment of Rainfall-Runoff Models Toolbox (MARRMoT) and the open-source Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Floods cause extensive damage, especially if they affect large regions. Assessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding under current and future climate conditions. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments.
This study evaluates the extent to which models calibrated according to standard model calibration metrics such as the widely used Kling–Gupta efficiency are able to capture flood spatial coherence and triggering mechanisms.
To highlight challenges related to flood simulations, we investigate how flood timing, magnitude, and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling–Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance also in flood-related studies. Specifically, we compare how four well-known models (the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, SAC; the Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning model, HBV; the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC; and the mesoscale hydrologic model, mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes.
Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics are challenging as models underestimate flood magnitude, and flood timing is not necessarily well captured. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not always well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions.
From a large sample of catchments and with multiple models, we conclude that calibration on the integrated Kling–Gupta metric alone is likely to yield models that have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, undermining their utility for regional and future change assessments. We underscore that such assessments can be improved by developing flood-focused, multi-objective, and spatial calibration metrics, by improving flood generating process representation through model structure comparisons and by considering uncertainty in precipitation input.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Land models are increasingly used in terrestrial hydrology due to
their process-oriented representation of water and energy fluxes. A priori
specification of the grid size of the land models is typically defined based
on the spatial resolution of forcing data, the modeling objectives, the
available geospatial information, and computational resources. The
variability of the inputs, soil types, vegetation covers, and forcing is
masked or aggregated based on the a priori grid size. In this study, we propose an
alternative vector-based implementation to directly configure a land model
using unique combinations of land cover types, soil types, and other desired
geographical features that have hydrological significance, such as elevation
zone, slope, and aspect. The main contributions of this paper are to (1) implement the vector-based spatial configuration using the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model; (2) illustrate how the spatial
configuration of the model affects simulations of basin-average quantities
(i.e., streamflow) as well as the spatial variability of internal processes
(snow water equivalent, SWE, and evapotranspiration, ET); and (3) describe the work and challenges ahead to improve the
spatial structure of land models. Our results show that a model
configuration with a lower number of computational units, once calibrated,
may have similar accuracy to model configurations with more computational
units. However, the different calibrated parameter sets produce a range of,
sometimes contradicting, internal states and fluxes. To better address the
shortcomings of the current generation of land models, we encourage the land
model community to adopt flexible spatial configurations to improve model
representations of fluxes and states at the scale of interest.},
