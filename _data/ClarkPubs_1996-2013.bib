	abstract = {Seasonal snow simulations are produced for the South Island of New Zealand using a relatively simple temperature-index snow model. Results show that the snow simulations are broadly consistent with the observed snow climatology, especially with respect to estimates of snow volume and snow duration. For the parameter sets tested, snow simulations were more realistic for those for which there is strong seasonal variability in melt and where the temperature threshold for snow accumulation is set to 1°C. However, we find strong interactions among the different parameters in the snow model that cannot be resolved with the available snow data. In the short-term, detailed basin-specific studies are necessary to refine model parameter values.},

This paper reports on a non-statistical way to update the groundwater state of rainfall runoff models based on TOPMODEL concepts. The updating procedure uses measured flows and an analytical relationship between water table position and baseflow. To apply the procedure it is desirable to define periods when there is no surface runoff to the stream network. An innovative and effective model-based way to define these periods is described. By assimilating measured flow data into a TopNet flood forecasting model, the forecasts of both high and low flows are improved, with the changes in water table position being consistent with the corrections to the forecast hydrograph.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/43944886},
	abstract = {Daily rainfall data from about 200 automatic weather stations are operationally interpolated onto a regular grid of points covering all of New Zealand at a resolution of 0.05 degrees lat/long (approximately 5 km). These data, as well as daily values for 10 other climate variables, are known as NIWAs Virtual Climate Station (VCS) data. There is a need to understand the accuracy of the daily rainfall estimates, particularly for hydrological assessments. The provision of historic daily rainfall data from more than 700 Regional Council locations (many of which are no longer operational) not used in the generation of the VCS estimates, has enabled a robust error assessment. Using a regression model approach (where the VCS rainfall is the independent variable and the Regional Council rainfall is the dependent variable), bias corrections were determined and applied to every VCS daily rainfall {\textgreater} 1 mm. The bias-corrected VCS rainfall mean absolute error for locations below about 500 m elevation is approximately 2-4 mm (95\% of the range) when rain days only (VCS rainfall ≥ 1 mm) are analysed. The error (and its spatial variation) is higher in areas above 500 m elevation, at approximately 5-15 mm. For daily VCS rainfalls {\textgreater} 40 mm (heavy rain days), the errors are approximately 8-12 mm (low elevation areas) and 10-40 mm (high elevation areas), and for monthly rainfall totals the corresponding errors are approximately 10-15 mm and 10-120 mm. For some uses of daily rainfall data, the installation of good quality telemetered rain gauges is the only option. However, if gauges can't be installed or the data collection cannot be maintained long-term, then using the bias-corrected VCS rainfall data is a viable option that is often a significant improvement over using data from distant stations that may not be in the same catchment or even located in a similar climatic zone.},
