	abstract = {The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) produces the latest generation of satellite precipitation estimates and has been widely used since its release in 2014. IMERG V06 provides global rainfall and snowfall data beginning from 2000. This study comprehensively analyzes the quality of the IMERG product at daily and hourly scales in China from 2000 to 2018 with special attention paid to snowfall estimates. The performance of IMERG is compared with nine satellite and reanalysis products (TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP, CHIRPS, SM2RAIN, ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA2). Results show that the IMERG product outperforms other datasets, except the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), which uses daily-scale station data to adjust satellite precipitation estimates. The monthly-scale station data adjustment used by IMERG naturally has a limited impact on estimates of precipitation occurrence and intensity at the daily and hourly time scales. The quality of IMERG has improved over time, attributed to the increasing number of passive microwave samples. SM2RAIN, ERA5, and MERRA2 also exhibit increasing accuracy with time that may cause variable performance in climatological studies. Even relying on monthly station data adjustments, IMERG shows good performance in both accuracy metrics at hourly time scales and the representation of diurnal cycles. In contrast, although ERA5 is acceptable at the daily scale, it degrades at the hourly scale due to the limitation in reproducing the peak time, magnitude and variation of diurnal cycles. IMERG underestimates snowfall compared with gauge and reanalysis data. The triple collocation analysis suggests that IMERG snowfall is worse than reanalysis and gauge data, which partly results in the degraded quality of IMERG in cold climates. This study demonstrates new findings on the uncertainties of various precipitation products and identifies potential directions for algorithm improvement. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite rainfall products.},

	abstract = {Low accuracy and coarse spatial resolution are the two main drawbacks of satellite precipitation products. Therefore, calibration and downscaling are necessary before these products are applied. This study proposes a two-step framework to improve the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates. The first step is data merging based on optimum interpolation (OI), and the second step is downscaling based on geographically weighted regression (GWR); therefore, the framework is called OI-GWR. An Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) product is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of OI-GWR in the Tianshan Mountains, China. First, the original IMERG precipitation data (OIMERG) are merged with rain gauge data using the OI method to produce corrected IMERG precipitation data (CIMERG). Then, using CIMERG as the first guess and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the auxiliary variable, GWR is utilized for spatial downscaling. The two-step OI-GWR method is compared with several traditional methods, including GWR downscaling (Ori\_GWR) and spline interpolation. The cross-validation results show that (1) the OI method noticeably improves the accuracy of OIMERG, and (2) the 1-km downscaled data obtained using OI-GWR are much better than those obtained from Ori\_GWR, spline interpolation, and OIMERG. The proposed OI-GWR method can contribute to the development of high-resolution and high-accuracy regional precipitation datasets. However, it should be noted that the method proposed in this study cannot be applied in regions without any meteorological stations. In addition, further efforts will be needed to achieve daily- or hourly-scale downscaling of precipitation.},

Overall, the spatial distributions of extreme events show significant regional variability and land-ocean contrast. Extreme precipitation is dominant over tropical ocean while extreme convections are exclusive over land from tropics to higher latitude. Besides, there are strong positive relationships between extreme convections and precipitation based on multiple threshold-based definitions of extremes, which provides more consistent physical properties of extreme events globally. The correlation is significant over land but relatively weak over oceans. Seasonal occurrences of extreme events are also examined. Furthermore, extreme events exhibit notable diurnal characteristics over global land with most extreme convections occurring in the afternoon, while diurnal cycles are more homogeneous over ocean.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for merging soil moisture retrievals from spaceborne active and passive microwave instruments based on weighted averaging taking into account the error characteristics of the individual data sets. The merging scheme is parameterized using error variance estimates obtained from using triple collocation analysis (TCA). In regions where TCA is deemed unreliable, we use correlation significance levels (p-values) as indicator for retrieval quality to decide whether to use active data only, passive data only, or an unweighted average. We apply the proposed merging scheme to active retrievals from advanced scatterometer and passive retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System using Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah to complement the triplet required for TCA. The merged time series is evaluated against soil moisture estimates from ERA-Interim/Land and in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network using the European Space Agency's (ESA's) current Climate Change Initiative-Soil Moisture (ESA CCI SM) product version v02.3 as benchmark merging scheme. Results show that the p-value classification provides a robust basis for decisions regarding using either active or passive data alone, or an unweighted average in cases where relative weights cannot be estimated reliably, and that the weights estimated from TCA in almost all cases outperform the ternary decision upon which the ESA CCI SM v02.3 is based. The proposed method forms the basis for the new ESA CCI SM product version v03.x and higher.},

They provide a global picture of how precipitation varies across time and space, specifically in regions where ground-based observations are scarce. While the application of global precipitation products has become widespread, there is limited knowledge on how well these products represent the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation—the key features in triggering flood hazards. Here, five global precipitation datasets (MSWEP, CFSR, CPC, PERSIANN-CDR, and WFDEI) are compared to each other and to surface observations. The spatial variability of relatively high precipitation events (tail heaviness) and the resulting discrepancy among datasets in the predicted precipitation return levels were evaluated for the time period 1979–2017. The analysis shows that 1) these products do not provide a consistent representation of the behavior of extremes as quantified by the tail heaviness, 2) there is strong spatial variability in the tail index, 3) the spatial patterns of the tail heaviness generally match the Köppen–Geiger climate classification, and 4) the predicted return levels for 100 and 1000 years differ significantly among the gridded products. More generally, our findings reveal shortcomings of global precipitation products in representing extremes and highlight that there is no single global product that performs best for all regions and climates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Small watersheds are ideal objects for studying the evolution of hydrological and water resources at small scales. Whether precipitation products can meet the runoff simulation of small watersheds is the main purpose of this study. With NOAA-CPC-US precipitation as a reference, in nine small watersheds of the United States, accuracy of the precipitation products such as PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CDR, TRMM-3B42V7, GPM-IMERG, StageIV, and ERA5 is analyzed. By driving the CREST hydrological model using these datasets, the runoff simulation effects were evaluated. Result shows the precipitation products match the NOAA-CPC-US from high to low in the order of StageIV, PERSIANN-CDR, GPM-IMERG, PERSIANN, ERA5, and finally TRMM-3B42 V7. These datasets have relatively low accuracy in the northern high latitude area and the western mountains, while accuracy is better in the central, southern, and eastern parts of the United States. In the runoff simulation effectiveness evaluation, the daily runoff of watersheds is simulated during the same verification period. The results show that: NOAA-CPC-US and StageIV have good simulation effect in small watersheds. In the northern and western United States, the PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CDR, GPM-IMERG, and ERA5 for runoff simulation should be used with caution. TRMM-3B42V7 is not suitable for runoff simulation in small watershed.},

In this study, we firstly apply various statistical indicators to evaluate and compare the main current satellite-based precipitation products from Chinese Fengyun (FY)-2 and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), respectively, over mainland China in summer, 2018. We find that (1) FY-2G QPE and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) perform significantly better than FY-2E QPE, using rain gauge data, with correlation coefficients (CC) varying from 0.65 to 0.90, 0.80 to 0.90, and 0.40 to 0.53, respectively; (2) IMERG agrees well with rain gauge data at monthly scale, while it performs worse than FY-2G QPE at hourly and daily scales, which may be caused by its algorithms; (3) FY-2G QPE underestimates the precipitation in summer, while FY-2E QPE and IMERG generally overestimate the precipitation; (4) there is an interesting error phenomenon in that both FY-based and GPM-based precipitation products perform more poorly during the period from 06:00 to 10:00 UTC than other periods at diurnal scale; and (5) FY-2G QPE agrees well with IMERG in terms of spatial patterns and consistency (CC of {\textasciitilde}0.81). These findings can provide valuable preliminary references for improving next generation satellite-based QPE retrieval algorithms and instructions for applying these data in various practical fields.},

Methods of obtaining comprehensive water cycle data are also expanded by new remote sensing techniques, and the vast amount of data has become increasingly available and thus accelerated a new Era: the Remote Sensing Big Data Study of Global Water Cycle. The element inversion, time and space reconstruction, and scale conversion are three key scientific issues for remote sensing water cycle in such Era.

With a focus on extremes, the overarching goal of this study is to cross-examine the similarities and differences of three state-of-the-art independent products (Muti-Radar Muti-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimates, MRMS; National Center for Environmental Prediction gridded gauge-only hourly precipitation product, NCEP; Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM, IMERG), with both traditional metrics and the Multiplicative Triple Collection (MTC) method during Hurricane Harvey and multiple Tropical Cyclones. The results reveal that: (a) the consistency of cross-examination results against traditional metrics approves the applicability of MTC in extreme events; (b) the consistency of cross-events of MTC evaluation results also suggests its robustness across individual storms; (c) all products demonstrate their capacity of capturing the spatial and temporal variability of the storm structures while also magnifying respective inherent deficiencies; (d) NCEP and IMERG likely underestimate while MRMS overestimates the storm total accumulation, especially for the 500-year return Hurricane Harvey; (e) both NCEP and IMERG underestimate extreme rainrates (\&gt;= 90 mm/h) likely due to device insensitivity or saturation while MRMS maintains robust across the rainrate range; (g) all three show inherent deficiencies in capturing the storm core of Harvey possibly due to device malfunctions with the NCEP gauges, relative low spatiotemporal resolution of IMERG, and the unusual \&ldquo;hot\&rdquo; MRMS radar signals. Given the unknown ground reference assumption of MTC, this study suggests that MRMS has the best overall performance. The similarities, differences, advantages, and deficiencies revealed in this study could guide the users for emergency response and motivate the community not only to improve the respective sensor/algorithm but also innovate multidata merging methods for one best possible product, specifically suitable for extreme storm events.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) information is fundamental to global precipitation estimation. Although researchers have developed numerous IR-based retrieval algorithms, there is still plenty of scope for promoting their accuracy. This article develops a novel deep learning-based algorithm entitled infrared precipitation estimation using a convolutional neural network (IPEC). Based on the five-channel IR data, the IPEC first identifies the precipitation occurrence and then estimates the precipitation rates at hourly and 0.04° x 0.04° resolutions. The performance of the IPEC is validated using the Stage-IV radar-gauge-combined data and compared to the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) in three subregions over the continental United States (CONUS). The results show that the five-channel input is more efficient in precipitation estimation than the commonly used one-channel input. The IPEC estimates based on the five-channel input show better statistical performance than the PERSIANN-CCS with 34.9\% gain in Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC), 38.0\% gain in relative bias (BIAS), and 45.2\% gain in mean squared error (MSE) during the testing period from June to August 2014 over the central CONUS. Furthermore, the optimized IPEC model is applied in totally independent periods and regions, and still achieves significantly better performance than the PERSIANN-CCS, indicating that the IPEC has a stronger generalization capability. On the whole, this article proves the effectiveness of the convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with the physical multichannel inputs in IR precipitation retrieval. This end-to-end deep learning algorithm shows the potential for serving as an operational technique that can be applied globally and provides a new perspective for the future development of satellite precipitation retrievals.},

	abstract = {Triple collocation (TC) is a novel method for quantifying the uncertainties of three data sets with mutually independent errors and has been widely used over different geographical fields. Researches in recent years report that TC shows potential in merging multiple data sets from different sources, while the TC-based merging method has not been used over precipitation. Using the TC formulation, this study merges precipitation from the Climate Prediction Center's morphing technique (CMORPH), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA5). The interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) is also involved to act as the substitute of ERA5 in some specific experiments for quality comparison between them. Merged data sets are produced at 0.25° x 0.25° and daily resolutions from March 2000 to December 2013 over Mainland China, using ground observations from more than 2000 rain gauges as the validation benchmark. First, the effectiveness of the TC-based method for precipitation merging is assessed. Then, two weighting methods using root-mean-square error (RMSE) in logarithmic scale (log-RMSE) and modified scale (mod-RMSE) are compared because previous studies show that mod-RMSE is more suitable for characterizing errors within estimated data. Meanwhile, two merging strategies are designed, that is, merging rainfall and snowfall separately (RS) and merging precipitation directly (P). The results show that 1) all the merged products are superior to any input product which proves that the TC method is effective in precipitation merging; 2) TC-based merging generally has a better performance than dynamic Bayesian model averaging (DBMA)-based merging; 3) mod-RMSE shows worse performance in weight estimation than log-RMSE because mod-RMSE will deteriorate the impact of the underestimated inputs; and 4) RS-based merging is superior to P-based merging, and the superiority is particularly notable in winter. The RS strategy will be very helpful in improving the accuracy of precipitation estimates in cold climate such as over mountainous and high-altitude regions. Finally, the limitations of the TC method and potential solutions are discussed. This study demonstrates the great potential of the TC-based merging method in precipitation and provides insights into its application and development.},

However, there rarely has been an application of IMERG products in flash flood warnings. Taking Yunnan Province as the typical study area, this study first evaluated the accuracy of the near-real-time IMERG Early run product (IMERG-E) and the post-real-time IMERG Final run product (IMERG-F) with a 6-hourly temporal resolution. Then the performance of the two products was analyzed with the improved Rainfall Triggering Index (RTI) in the flash flood warning. Results show that (1) IMERG-F presents acceptable accuracy over the study area, with a relatively high hourly correlation coefficient of 0.46 and relative bias of 23.33\% on the grid, which performs better than IMERG-E; and (2) when the RTI model is calibrated with the gauge data, the IMERG-F results matched well with the gauge data, indicating that it is viable to use MERG-F in flash flood warnings. However, as the flash flood occurrence increases, both gauge and IMERG-F data capture fewer flash flood events, and IMERG-F overestimates actual precipitation. Nevertheless, IMERG-F can capture more flood events than IMERG-E and can contribute to improving the accuracy of the flash flood warnings in Yunnan Province and other flood-prone areas.},

In ensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members are used to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, of a spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the available information. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications. This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America (EMDNA).

The station data used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America (SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements using multiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded, corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimal interpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates. EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated random fields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) the merged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates, particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimates are more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regression estimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident in sparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performance according to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. We discuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that further research is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall, EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorological applications in North America.

Rain gauges are indispensable in precipitation measurement, but are quite limited in the TP that features complex terrain and the harsh environment. Satellite and reanalysis precipitation products can provide complementary information for ground-based measurements, particularly over large poorly gauged areas. Here we optimally merged gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data by determining weights of various data sources using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and environmental variables including elevation, surface pressure, and wind speed. A Multi-Source Precipitation (MSP) data set was generated at a daily timescale and a spatial resolution of 0.1° across the TP for the 1998–2017 period. The correlation coefficient ({\textless}em{\textgreater}CC{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) of daily precipitation between the MSP and gauge observations was highest (0.74) and the root mean squared error was the second lowest compared with four other satellite products, indicating the quality of the MSP and the effectiveness of the data merging approach. We further evaluated the hydrological utility of different precipitation products using a distributed hydrological model for the poorly gauged headwaters of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in the TP. The MSP achieved the best Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (over 0.8) and {\textless}em{\textgreater}CC{\textless}/em{\textgreater} (over 0.9) for daily streamflow simulations during 2004–2014. In addition, the MSP performed best over the ungauged western TP based on multiple collocation evaluation.

Particularly, the recent Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product retrospectively provides an unprecedented two decades of high-resolution satellite precipitation estimates. The primary goal of this study is to examine the similarities and differences between the two latest and also arguably the most popular, GPM IMERG Early and Final Run (ER and FR) products across the globe. The results reveal that: (1) ER systematically estimates 12.0\% higher annual rainfall than FR, particularly over land (16.7\%); (2) ER and FR show significant differences in instantaneous rates (Root Mean Squared Difference: RMSD = 2.38 mm h−1 and normalized RMSD: RMSD\_norm = 1.09), especially in Africa (RMSD = 2.40 mm h−1) and hot, arid regions (RMSD\_norm = 1.11), but less so in Europe (RMSD = 2.16 mm h−1) and cold areas (RMSD\_norm = 0.87); and (3) ER measures 33.0\% higher extreme rainfall rates than FR over the globe. The exploration of their similarities and differences provides a first-order global assessment of various hydrological utilities: FR is designed to be more suitable for retrospective hydroclimatology and water resource applications, while the earliest available ER product, though not bias-corrected by rain gauges, still shows potential utility for operational modeling of rainfall-triggered hazards. The findings of this study can provide an assessment to product developers and broader data users and practitioners to address the inherent issues in hardware limitations, retrieval algorithms, and uncertainty quantification for research and applications.},

	abstract = {Although satellite-based precipitation estimation has extensive application potential, validation of its reliability is challenging for areas lacking ground-based data which is particularly true for many arid and semiarid regions. The triple collocation (TC) method can be used to evaluate three independent inputs with unknown true values, and thus provides an appealing alternative for assessment of satellite precipitation products in lack of observation regions. This study is the first to utilize TC to comprehensively assess the uncertainties of various satellite precipitation products in Central Asia (CA) with a distinctive continental arid and semi-arid climate. TC requires the errors of inputs to be independent with each other, while many multi-satellite precipitation products use overlapped data sources. To address this problem, this study uses a soil moisture-based product (SM2RAIN) and a reanalysis model-based product (ERA5) as two inputs of a triplet with the last input coming from each one of the six satellite precipitation products (3B42, CHIRPS, CMORPH, GSMaP, IMERG, PERSIANN). Six independent triplets are obtained in this way. The temporal/spatial resolution is daily/0.1° and the period is 2007–2019. The results show the overall performance of GSMaP is best among eight gridded precipitation products over CA, followed by IMERG, CMORPH and PERSIANN. All precipitation products show degraded performance with increasing altitude. Moreover, the accuracy estimates are subjected to uncertainties caused by the TC method and data inputs. Overall, the study concludes the TC method can provide a new perspective for the assessment of precipitation products over data-absent arid and semiarid regions, while careful check and explanation of evaluation results are always necessary to defend the rationality of TC in specific cases.},

	abstract = {High-quality and high-resolution precipitation products are critically important to many hydrological applications. Advances in satellite remote sensing instruments and data retrieval algorithms continue to improve the quality of the operational precipitation products. However, most satellite products existing today are still too coarse to be ingested for local water management and planning purposes. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms enable the fusion of multi-source, high-dimensional data for statistical learning. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an attention-based, deep convolutional neural network (AU-Net) for learning spatial and temporal mappings from coarse-resolution to fine-resolution precipitation products. The skills of AU-Net models, developed using combinations of static and dynamic predictors, were evaluated over a 3 × 3° study area in Central Texas, U.S., a region known for its complex precipitation patterns and low predictability. Three coarse-resolution satellite/reanalysis precipitation products, ERA5-Land (0.1°), TRMM (0.25°), and IMERG (0.1°), are used as part of the inputs, while the predictand is the 1-km PRISM data. Auxiliary predictors include elevation, vegetation index, and air temperature. The study period includes 18 years of data (2001–2018) at the monthly scale for training, validation, and testing. Results show that the trained AU-Net models achieve different degrees of success in downscaling the baseline coarse-resolution products, depending on the total precipitation, the accuracy of large-scale patterns captured by the baseline products, and the amount of information transferable from predictors. Higher precipitation rate tends to affect AU-Net model performance negatively. Use of the attention mechanism in the AU-Net models allows for infilling of multiscale features and generation of sharper images. Correction using gauge data, if there is any, can further improve the results significantly.},

The new SCD for North America (SCDNA) includes daily precipitation, minimum temperature ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}$_{\textrm{min⁡}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), and maximum temperature ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}$_{\textrm{max⁡}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) data for 27\&thinsp;276 stations. Raw meteorological station data were obtained from the Global Historical Climate Network Daily (GHCN-D), the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and a compiled station database in Mexico. Stations with at least 8-year-long records were selected, which underwent location correction and were subjected to strict quality control. Outputs from three reanalysis products (ERA5, JRA-55, and MERRA-2) provided auxiliary information to estimate station records. Infilling during the observation period and reconstruction beyond the observation period were accomplished by combining estimates from 16 strategies (variants of quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, and machine learning).

Gap filling is widely used to generate serially complete datasets (SCDs), which are subsequently used to produce gridded meteorological estimates. However, the value of SCDs in spatial interpolation is scarcely studied. Based on our recent efforts to develop a SCD over North America (SCDNA), we explore the extent to which gap filling improves gridded precipitation and temperature estimates. We address two specific questions: 1) Can SCDNA improve the statistical accuracy of gridded estimates in North America? 2) Can SCDNA improve estimates of trends on gridded data? In addressing these questions, we also evaluate the extent to which results depend on the spatial density of the station network and the spatial interpolation methods used. Results show that the improvement in statistical interpolation due to gap filling is more obvious for precipitation, followed by minimum temperature and maximum temperature. The improvement is larger when the station network is sparse and when simpler interpolation methods are used. SCDs can also notably reduce the uncertainties in spatial interpolation. Our evaluation across North America from 1979 to 2018 demonstrates that SCDs improve the accuracy of interpolated estimates for most stations and days. SCDNA-based interpolation also obtains better trend estimation than observation-based interpolation. This occurs because stations used for interpolation could change during a specific period, causing changepoints in interpolated temperature estimates and affect the long-term trends of observation-based interpolation, which can be avoided using SCDNA. Overall, SCDs improve the performance of gridded precipitation and temperature estimates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

One major challenge is that the microwave data are discontinuous in space and time. We present a novel approach to merge incomplete passive microwave (PMW) precipitation estimates using the conditional information provided by complete infrared (IR) precipitation estimates based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), and name the algorithm PrecipGAN. PrecipGAN decomposes the precipitation system into content and evolution subspaces to propagate PMW estimates to regions outside the orbit coverage of PMW sensors. PrecipGAN can skillfully simulate the spatiotemporal changes of precipitation events, and produce precipitation estimates with overall better statistical performance than the baseline product Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Uncalibrated over the Continental US. PrecipGAN provides an alternative of accurate and computationally efficient algorithm that can be implemented globally to produce satellite-based precipitation estimates.},

Gap-filling and reconstruction techniques have proven to be effective in producing serially complete station datasets (SCDs) that are used for a myriad of meteorological applications (e.g., developing gridded meteorological datasets and validating models). To our knowledge, all SCDs are developed at regional scales. In this study, we developed the serially complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which provides daily precipitation, mean temperature, temperature range, dewpoint temperature, and wind speed data from 1950 to 2019. SC-Earth utilizes raw station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily (GHCN-D) and the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). A unified station repository is generated based on GHCN-D and GSOD after station merging and strict quality control. ERA5 is optimally matched with station data considering the time shift issue and then used to assist the global gap filling. SC-Earth is generated by merging estimates from 15 strategies based on quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, machine learning, and multistrategy merging. The final estimates are bias corrected using a combination of quantile mapping and quantile delta mapping. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that SC-Earth has high accuracy around the globe, with degraded quality in the tropics and oceanic islands due to sparse station networks, strong spatial precipitation gradients, and degraded ERA5 estimates. Meanwhile, SC-Earth inherits potential limitations such as inhomogeneity and precipitation undercatch from raw station data, which may affect its application in some cases. Overall, the high-quality and high-density SC-Earth dataset will benefit research in fields of hydrology, ecology, meteorology, and climate.

	abstract = {AbstractThe goal of this commentary is to critically evaluate the use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. We focus on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics, which are both widely used in hydrologic research and practice around the world. Our specific objectives are: (1) to provide tools that quantify the sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics; (2) to quantify sampling uncertainty in popular performance metrics across a large sample of catchments; and (3) to prescribe the further research that is needed to improve the estimation, interpretation, and use of popular performance metrics in hydrologic modeling. Our large-sample analysis demonstrates that there is substantial sampling uncertainty in the NSE and KGE estimators. This occurs because the probability distribution of squared errors between model simulations and observations has heavy tails, meaning that performance metrics can be heavily influenced by just a few data points. Our results highlight obvious (yet ignored) abuses of performance metrics that contaminate the conclusions of many hydrologic modeling studies: It is essential to quantify the sampling uncertainty in performance metrics when justifying the use of a model for a specific purpose and when comparing the performance of competing models.This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Flash floods, characterized by rapid, short-duration, and high-velocity flows, are the major causes of property damage and casualties worldwide. Flash flood warning is one of the key measures to prevent flash floods. Relying upon rain gage data and official statistics of flash flood events with casualties, this study proposes a new rainfall triggering index, β, defined as the ratio of accumulated rainfall to intraday rainfall, which effectively divides floods into events triggered by heavy intraday rainfall (0 {\textless} β ≤ 5) and those triggered by high cumulative rainfall (β {\textgreater} 5). Then, historical disaster events were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed index. Results reveal that: (1) when 0 {\textless} β ≤ 5, the intensity–duration (I–D) curve method is more desirable, and the simulation result has a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.95) with the measured result; (2) when β {\textgreater} 5, the rainfall triggering index (RTI) method is more suitable (r = 0.8); (3) the cumulative critical rainfall using the RTI method ranges from 50 to 400 mm. This paper stretches the thought of flash flood warning method and provides the reference for flood-prone regions.},

However, various studies have shown that the multiplicative model is more suitable to describe the errors of precipitation than the additive model. This study integrates the multiplicative model with the Willmott–AghaKouchak method to characterize the errors of four selected representative satellite precipitation products in China. Zero precipitation is addressed by adding a tiny increment, which is determined by a sensitivity analysis, enabling the examination of missed precipitation and false alarms compared with the traditional strategy that only considers hit events. The results show that the systematic errors based on the additive model are too sensitive to heavy precipitation, resulting in problems, such as unexpected fluctuations, regional biases, unsteady performance, and reverse seasonal and elevational trends in some cases. In contrast, the multiplicative model resolves these problems through balancing the contributions of light and heavy precipitation and is recommended for systematic and random error estimation.},

Near-real-time (NRT) satellite precipitation products are attractive to rainstorm monitoring and flood warning guidance owing to its combination of timeliness, high spatiotemporal resolution, and broad coverage. We evaluate the performance of four NRT satellite products, i.e., Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, 3B42RT, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) NRT, and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Late run using a high-quality merged product in the rainy June over South China. In addition, a method based on an empirical flash flood guidance and the Flash Flood Potential Index is proposed to examine the applicability of satellite products in guiding flood warning. The IMERG Late run and GSMaP NRT perform the closest-to-ground observations. 3B42RT detects the most flood warning events due to its notable overestimation of actual precipitation. We recommend that the IMERG Late run is the best NRT satellite product in capturing flood hazard events according to the Pareto Efficiency of jointly optimizing higher hit ratio and lower false alarms.},

Based on our results, caution should be exercised when using CMORPH and PERSIANN-CCS as input for monitoring and forecasting floods in Beijing urban areas, and the potential for landslides in the mountainous zones west and north of Beijing.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is able to provide information on global rain and snow, but challenges remain in accurate estimation of precipitation rates, particularly in snow retrieval. In this work, the deep neural network (DNN) is applied to estimate rain and snow rates in high latitudes. The reference data for DNN training are provided by two spaceborne radars onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory and CloudSat. Passive microwave data from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), infrared data from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and environmental data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are trained to the spaceborne radar-based reference precipitation. The DNN estimates are compared to data from the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF), which is used to retrieve passive microwave precipitation for the GPM mission. First, the DNN-based retrieval method performs well in both training and testing periods. Second, the DNN can reveal the advantages and disadvantages of different channels of GMI and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Additionally, infrared and environmental data can improve precipitation estimation of the DNN, particularly for snowfall. Finally, based on the optimized DNN, rain and snow are estimated in 2017 from orbital GMI brightness temperatures and compared to ERA-Interim and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data. Evaluation results show that (1) the DNN can largely mitigate the underestimation of precipitation rates in high latitudes by GPROF; (2) the DNN-based snowfall estimates largely outperform those of GPROF; and (3) the spatial distributions of DNN-based precipitation are closer to reanalysis data. The method and assessment presented in this study could potentially contribute to the substantial improvement of satellite precipitation products in high latitudes.
Plain Language Summary Snow has a significant influence on the hydrological cycle and water resource availability. Compared to ground gauges and radars with limited coverage, satellite remote sensing can provide global rain and snow observations from space. However, traditional satellite precipitation retrieval methods are prone to errors in snow estimation at high latitudes. In this study, we developed a new rain and snow estimation method at high latitudes using deep neural networks. The reference data sets were from two spaceborne radars that provide the most direct precipitation observations from space. Passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data were trained to the reference data sets for rain and snow estimation. Results show that the neural network-based method can largely reduce the underestimation of rain and snow rates in high latitudes in many prior algorithms. Statistical indices for snow estimation are notably improved. Furthermore, combining data from passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data sets contribute to better precipitation estimation than a single source. We suggest that deep neural networks could potentially contribute to the improvement of satellite precipitation at high latitudes, which is valuable for expanding the spatial coverage of current satellite products.},

	abstract = {Precipitation is one of the most important components in the water and energy cycles. Radars are considered the best available technology for observing the spatial distribution of precipitation either from the ground since the 1980s or from space since 1998. This study, for the first time ever, compares and evaluates the only three existing spaceborne precipitation radars, i.e., the Ku-band precipitation radar (PR), the W-band Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), and the Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The three radars are matched up globally and intercompared in the only period which they coexist: 2014-2015. In addition, for the first time ever, TRMM PR and GPM DPR are evaluated against hourly rain gauge data in Mainland China. Results show that DPR and PR agree with each other and correlate very well with gauges in Mainland China. However, both show limited performance in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole. DPR improves light precipitation detectability, when compared with PR, whereas CPR performs best for light precipitation and snowfall. DPR snowfall has the advantage of higher sampling rates than CPR; however, its accuracy needs to be improved further. The future development of spaceborne radars is also discussed in two complementary categories: (1) multifrequency radar instruments on a single platform and (2) constellations of many small cube radar satellites, for improving global precipitation estimation. This comprehensive intercomparison of PR, CPR, and DPR sheds light on spaceborne radar precipitation retrieval and future radar design.},

The relative difference (RD) was calculated between precipitation estimates over pixels containing water bodies and over pixels neighboring water bodies. A t-test was employed to check the statistical significance. Results show that similar to 53\% of the water bodies passed the significance test at the daily scale for the TRMM products on average. Gauge adjustment alleviates the overestimation of 3B42V7 (mean RD = 20\%) compared with 3B42RT (mean RD = 34\%). Liquid water surfaces tend to affect the quality of TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis more significantly than ice water surfaces due to different passive microwave (MW) emission characteristics. In contrast, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission products provide more consistent precipitation estimates, with only similar to 4\% of the water bodies passing the significance test. TRMM-based precipitation estimates are much higher than GPM products over inland water bodies, which is, however, not the case over the land. The improvement is mainly attributed to the unified and updated MW algorithm used in GPM products.},

	abstract = {Abstract Gridded meteorological estimates are essential for many applications. Most existing meteorological datasets are deterministic and have limitations in representing the inherent uncertainties from both the data and methodology used to create gridded products. We develop the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for Planet Earth (EM-Earth) for precipitation, mean daily temperature, daily temperature range, and dewpoint temperature at 0.1° spatial resolution over global land areas from 1950 to 2019. EM-Earth provides hourly/daily deterministic estimates, and daily probabilistic estimates (25 ensemble members), to meet the diverse requirements of hydrometeorological applications. To produce EM-Earth, we first developed a station-based Serially Complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which removes the temporal discontinuities in raw station observations. Then, we optimally merged SC-Earth station data and ERA5 estimates to generate EM-Earth deterministic estimates and their uncertainties. The EM-Earth ensemble members are produced by sampling from parametric probability distributions using spatiotemporally correlated random fields. The EM-Earth dataset is evaluated by leave-one-out validation, using independent evaluation stations, and comparing it with many widely used datasets. The results show that EM-Earth is better in Europe, North America, and Oceania than in Africa, Asia, and South America, mainly due to differences in the available stations and differences in climate conditions. Probabilistic spatial meteorological datasets are particularly valuable in regions with large meteorological uncertainties, where almost all existing deterministic datasets face great challenges in obtaining accurate estimates.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate the precipitation-phase partitioning capabilities of remote sensing and reanalysis modeling methods on the global scale.

The results show that: (1) the ERA5 performs better than the IMERG at distinguishing rainfall and snowfall events, overall. (2) The ERA5 has high accuracy in all continents except for South America, while the IMERG performs well only in Antarctica and North America. (3) Compared with the IMERG, the ERA5 can more effectively capture snowfall events at high latitudes but shows worse performance at mid-low latitude regions. Both the IMERG and ERA5 have lower accuracy for rain–snow partitioning under heavy precipitation.

The results show that all datasets can capture the spatial pattern of SM in China. TC-based correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) show that the station data have worse performance in western and central China. For most stations, TC-based CC is between 0.6{\textasciitilde}0.9, and TC-based RMSE is between 0.01{\textasciitilde}0.06 m3/m3. In addition, TC-based metrics show good agreement with the CC between precipitation and SM, indicating that these metrics can reflect the quality of station data. We further selected typical stations (e.g., CC ≤ 0.2, RMSE ≥ 0.06 m3/m3) to check the quality of the QC procedure. The comparison shows that TC-based metrics can better represent the actual quality for these stations compared to raw QC flags. This study indicates that TC has the potential to detect problematic stations and could be a supplement to traditional QC of station observations.},

However, existing precipitation datasets for the Third Pole (TP) basins show large discrepancies in precipitation magnitudes and spatiotemporal patterns, which poses a great challenge to hydrological simulations in the TP basins. In this study, a gridded (10 km×10 km) daily precipitation dataset is constructed through a random forest-based machine learning algorithm (RF algorithm) correction of the ERA5 precipitation estimates based on 940 gauges in 11 upper basins of TP for 1951–2020. The data set is evaluated by gauge observations at point scale, and is inversely evaluated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model linked with a glacier melt algorithm (VIC-Glacier). The corrected ERA5 (ERA5\_cor) agrees well with gauge observations after eliminating the severe overestimation in the original ERA5 precipitation. The corrections greatly reduce the original ERA5 precipitation estimates by 10\%–50\% in 11 basins of the TP, and present more details on precipitation spatial variability. The inverse hydrological model evaluation demonstrates the accuracy and rationality, and we provide an updated estimate of runoff components contribution to total runoff in seven upper basins in the TP based on the VIC-Glacier model simulations with the ERA5\_cor precipitation. This study provides good precipitation estimates with high spatiotemporal resolution for 11 upper basins in the TP, which are expected to facilitate the hydrological modeling and prediction studies in this high mountainous region.},

	abstract = {Characterizing error structures in precipitation products not only facilitates their proper applications for scientific and practical purposes but also helps improve their retrieval algorithms and processing methods. Despite the fact that multiple precipitation products have been assessed in the literature, factors that affect their error structures remain inadequately addressed. By interpreting 60 binary decision trees, this study disentangles the error characteristics of precipitation products in terms of their spatiotemporal patterns and geographical factors. Three independent precipitation products - two satellite-based and one reanalysis datasets: the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) late run (IMERG-L), Soil Moisture to Rain-Advanced SCATterometer (SM2RAIN-ASCAT), and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 uncorrected precipitation output (MERRA2-UC), are evaluated across the contiguous United States from 2010 to 2019. The ground-based Stage IV precipitation dataset is used as the ground truth. Results indicate that the MERRA2-UC outperforms the IMERG-L and SM2RAIN-ASCAT with higher accuracy and more stable interannual patterns for the analysis period. Decision trees cross-assess three spatiotemporal factors and find that the underestimation of MERRA2-UC occurs in the east of the Rocky Mountains, and SM2RAIN-ASCAT underestimates precipitation over high latitudes, especially in winter. Additionally, the decision tree method ascribes system errors to nine different geographical characteristics, of which the distance to the coast, soil type, and DEM are the three dominant features. On the other hand, the land cover type, topography position index, and aspect are three relatively weak factors.},

	abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique has demonstrated its potential for terrestrial applications. Over inland water bodies, the dominance of coherent components in GNSS-R has been widely recognized. Nevertheless, little attention is given to GNSS-R speckle, which is inherent to coherent imaging systems. In this study, taking the multiplicative speckle into account, we regard GNSS-R coherent scattering as a statistical distribution. First, the expression of the statistical distribution is identified and parameterized using observations from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS). The results suggest that the power tends to obey a three-degrees-of-freedom distribution model. Second, the multilook statistics of CyGNSS, such as the mean value and the coefficient of variation (CV), are analyzed on different spatial–temporal scales. Finally, we realize surface water mapping using multilook statistics. Comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the goodness of water mapping, with higher overall accuracies ( 0.97) and F1 scores ( 0.60). This study provides new insights into future GNSS-R land observations.},

	abstract = {Improved quantification of extreme precipitation rates using observations has far-reaching implications for environmental sciences, especially for hydrometeorological studies. Yet, uncertainties still remain in satellite precipitation estimates, especially for a merged product. This study evaluates the performance of the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) in extreme events over the conterminous US. Three approaches are followed to define and evaluate extreme events: (1) a percentile-based analysis, (2) an event-based analysis using the National Weather Service storm database, and (3) a frequency-based analysis using intensity–durationfrequency (IDF) curves. The IMERG Early Run (ER), Late Run (LR), and Final Run (FR) products and their original passive microwave and infrared (IR) sensors are intercompared against the National Centers for Environmental Predictions Stage IV ground-based radar precipitation data from 2015 to 2019. In particular, we break down the performance in three types of events (rain, snow, and hail). The results reveal that: (1) three types of extreme definitions converge toward an overall agreement - the degrees of underestimation of high-end extreme precipitation rates increases with data latency (FR {\textgreater} LR {\textgreater} ER) and FR delivers overall best performance; (2) passive microwave (PMW) estimates generally exhibits better detectability and quantification of extreme precipitation than IR estimates, especially in heavy rains; (3) Amongst PMW sensors, MHS (SAPHIR)-based estimates show the best (worst) extreme detection with CSI (Critical Success Index) equaling 0.15 (0.10) while AMSR and SSMIS outperform others for quantifying extreme rates. Lastly, different sensors (e.g., imagers and sounders in PMW and IR) deliver variable performance regarding different precipitation types. These findings reveal that IMERG is not a homogeneous precipitation product when it comes to estimating precipitation extremes. There are rooms for improvement to enhance homogeneity across precipitation estimates used in IMERG.},

	abstract = {The Köppen-Geiger (KG) climate classification has been widely used to determine the climate at global and regional scales using precipitation and temperature data. KG maps are typically developed using a single product; however, uncertainties in KG climate types resulting from different precipitation and temperature datasets have not been explored in detail. Here, we assess seven global datasets to show uncertainties in KG classification from 1980 to 2017. Using a pairwise comparison at global and zonal scales, we quantify the similarity among the seven KG maps. Gauge- and reanalysis-based KG maps have a notable difference. Spatially, the highest and lowest similarity is observed for the North and South Temperate zones, respectively. Notably, 17\% of grids among the seven maps show variations even in the major KG climate types, while 35\% of grids are described by more than one KG climate subtype. Strong uncertainty is observed in south Asia, central and south Africa, western America, and northeastern Australia. We created two KG master maps (0.5° resolution) by merging the climate maps directly and by combining the precipitation and temperature data from the seven datasets. These master maps are more robust than the individual ones showing coherent spatial patterns. This study reveals the large uncertainty in climate classification and offers two robust KG maps that may help to better evaluate historical climate and quantify future climate shifts.},

	abstract = {Infrared (IR) is an important data source for satellite quantitative precipitation estimation, and has been widely applied in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. In the past decades, a series of IR retrieval algorithms have been developed to support the production of IR-based and IR-microwave merged precipitation products. Recently, deep learning techniques such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) show great potential in obtaining IR precipitation estimates with higher accuracy than traditional retrieval algorithms. In this study, we present an upgraded version of IR Precipitation Estimation using CNN (IPEC), i.e., IPEC version 2 (IPEC-V2), with a new end-to-end manner. IPEC-V2 is used to generate a precipitation dataset based on IR data from China’s Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellites (FY-2F, 2G, and 4A). To overcome the difficulty of model training in regions with sparse observations, IPEC-V2 models are firstly pre-trained over the data-rich Continental US (CONUS) using IR data from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES). The models are then transferred to China through re-training with multi-band IR signals from FY satellites. Finally, a long-term record of high-resolution FY IR precipitation estimates is produced during the period from November 9, 2012 to February 28, 2021, which is named as IPEC-FY. IPEC-FY shows better performance than the baseline Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) with 76.2\% gain in Pearson’s correlation coefficient and 18.4\% gain in root mean squared error in China. This study shows that transfer learning is an effective way to build CNN models in regions without enough observations, and the high-quality IPEC-FY can act as an alternative precipitation dataset for research in China.},
