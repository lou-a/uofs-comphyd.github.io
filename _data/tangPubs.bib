	abstract = {Infrared (IR) information is fundamental to global precipitation estimation. Although researchers have developed numerous IR-based retrieval algorithms, there is still plenty of scope for promoting their accuracy. This article develops a novel deep learning-based algorithm entitled infrared precipitation estimation using a convolutional neural network (IPEC). Based on the five-channel IR data, the IPEC first identifies the precipitation occurrence and then estimates the precipitation rates at hourly and 0.04° x 0.04° resolutions. The performance of the IPEC is validated using the Stage-IV radar-gauge-combined data and compared to the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) in three subregions over the continental United States (CONUS). The results show that the five-channel input is more efficient in precipitation estimation than the commonly used one-channel input. The IPEC estimates based on the five-channel input show better statistical performance than the PERSIANN-CCS with 34.9\% gain in Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC), 38.0\% gain in relative bias (BIAS), and 45.2\% gain in mean squared error (MSE) during the testing period from June to August 2014 over the central CONUS. Furthermore, the optimized IPEC model is applied in totally independent periods and regions, and still achieves significantly better performance than the PERSIANN-CCS, indicating that the IPEC has a stronger generalization capability. On the whole, this article proves the effectiveness of the convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with the physical multichannel inputs in IR precipitation retrieval. This end-to-end deep learning algorithm shows the potential for serving as an operational technique that can be applied globally and provides a new perspective for the future development of satellite precipitation retrievals.},

	abstract = {NASA\&rsquo;s Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) is a major source of precipitation data, having a larger coverage, higher precision, and a higher spatiotemporal resolution than previous products, such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). However, there rarely has been an application of IMERG products in flash flood warnings. Taking Yunnan Province as the typical study area, this study first evaluated the accuracy of the near-real-time IMERG Early run product (IMERG-E) and the post-real-time IMERG Final run product (IMERG-F) with a 6-hourly temporal resolution. Then the performance of the two products was analyzed with the improved Rainfall Triggering Index (RTI) in the flash flood warning. Results show that (1) IMERG-F presents acceptable accuracy over the study area, with a relatively high hourly correlation coefficient of 0.46 and relative bias of 23.33\% on the grid, which performs better than IMERG-E; and (2) when the RTI model is calibrated with the gauge data, the IMERG-F results matched well with the gauge data, indicating that it is viable to use MERG-F in flash flood warnings. However, as the flash flood occurrence increases, both gauge and IMERG-F data capture fewer flash flood events, and IMERG-F overestimates actual precipitation. Nevertheless, IMERG-F can capture more flood events than IMERG-E and can contribute to improving the accuracy of the flash flood warnings in Yunnan Province and other flood-prone areas.},

Overall, the spatial distributions of extreme events show significant regional variability and land-ocean contrast. Extreme precipitation is dominant over tropical ocean while extreme convections are exclusive over land from tropics to higher latitude. Besides, there are strong positive relationships between extreme convections and precipitation based on multiple threshold-based definitions of extremes, which provides more consistent physical properties of extreme events globally. The correlation is significant over land but relatively weak over oceans. Seasonal occurrences of extreme events are also examined. Furthermore, extreme events exhibit notable diurnal characteristics over global land with most extreme convections occurring in the afternoon, while diurnal cycles are more homogeneous over ocean.},

	abstract = {Triple collocation (TC) is a novel method for quantifying the uncertainties of three data sets with mutually independent errors and has been widely used over different geographical fields. Researches in recent years report that TC shows potential in merging multiple data sets from different sources, while the TC-based merging method has not been used over precipitation. Using the TC formulation, this study merges precipitation from the Climate Prediction Center's morphing technique (CMORPH), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA5). The interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) is also involved to act as the substitute of ERA5 in some specific experiments for quality comparison between them. Merged data sets are produced at 0.25° x 0.25° and daily resolutions from March 2000 to December 2013 over Mainland China, using ground observations from more than 2000 rain gauges as the validation benchmark. First, the effectiveness of the TC-based method for precipitation merging is assessed. Then, two weighting methods using root-mean-square error (RMSE) in logarithmic scale (log-RMSE) and modified scale (mod-RMSE) are compared because previous studies show that mod-RMSE is more suitable for characterizing errors within estimated data. Meanwhile, two merging strategies are designed, that is, merging rainfall and snowfall separately (RS) and merging precipitation directly (P). The results show that 1) all the merged products are superior to any input product which proves that the TC method is effective in precipitation merging; 2) TC-based merging generally has a better performance than dynamic Bayesian model averaging (DBMA)-based merging; 3) mod-RMSE shows worse performance in weight estimation than log-RMSE because mod-RMSE will deteriorate the impact of the underestimated inputs; and 4) RS-based merging is superior to P-based merging, and the superiority is particularly notable in winter. The RS strategy will be very helpful in improving the accuracy of precipitation estimates in cold climate such as over mountainous and high-altitude regions. Finally, the limitations of the TC method and potential solutions are discussed. This study demonstrates the great potential of the TC-based merging method in precipitation and provides insights into its application and development.},

	abstract = {Small watersheds are ideal objects for studying the evolution of hydrological and water resources at small scales. Whether precipitation products can meet the runoff simulation of small watersheds is the main purpose of this study. With NOAA-CPC-US precipitation as a reference, in nine small watersheds of the United States, accuracy of the precipitation products such as PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CDR, TRMM-3B42V7, GPM-IMERG, StageIV, and ERA5 is analyzed. By driving the CREST hydrological model using these datasets, the runoff simulation effects were evaluated. Result shows the precipitation products match the NOAA-CPC-US from high to low in the order of StageIV, PERSIANN-CDR, GPM-IMERG, PERSIANN, ERA5, and finally TRMM-3B42 V7. These datasets have relatively low accuracy in the northern high latitude area and the western mountains, while accuracy is better in the central, southern, and eastern parts of the United States. In the runoff simulation effectiveness evaluation, the daily runoff of watersheds is simulated during the same verification period. The results show that: NOAA-CPC-US and StageIV have good simulation effect in small watersheds. In the northern and western United States, the PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CDR, GPM-IMERG, and ERA5 for runoff simulation should be used with caution. TRMM-3B42V7 is not suitable for runoff simulation in small watershed.},

They provide a global picture of how precipitation varies across time and space, specifically in regions where ground-based observations are scarce. While the application of global precipitation products has become widespread, there is limited knowledge on how well these products represent the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation—the key features in triggering flood hazards. Here, five global precipitation datasets (MSWEP, CFSR, CPC, PERSIANN-CDR, and WFDEI) are compared to each other and to surface observations. The spatial variability of relatively high precipitation events (tail heaviness) and the resulting discrepancy among datasets in the predicted precipitation return levels were evaluated for the time period 1979–2017. The analysis shows that 1) these products do not provide a consistent representation of the behavior of extremes as quantified by the tail heaviness, 2) there is strong spatial variability in the tail index, 3) the spatial patterns of the tail heaviness generally match the Köppen–Geiger climate classification, and 4) the predicted return levels for 100 and 1000 years differ significantly among the gridded products. More generally, our findings reveal shortcomings of global precipitation products in representing extremes and highlight that there is no single global product that performs best for all regions and climates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Rain gauges are indispensable in precipitation measurement, but are quite limited in the TP that features complex terrain and the harsh environment. Satellite and reanalysis precipitation products can provide complementary information for ground-based measurements, particularly over large poorly gauged areas. Here we optimally merged gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data by determining weights of various data sources using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and environmental variables including elevation, surface pressure, and wind speed. A Multi-Source Precipitation (MSP) data set was generated at a daily timescale and a spatial resolution of 0.1° across the TP for the 1998–2017 period. The correlation coefficient ({\textless}em{\textgreater}CC{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) of daily precipitation between the MSP and gauge observations was highest (0.74) and the root mean squared error was the second lowest compared with four other satellite products, indicating the quality of the MSP and the effectiveness of the data merging approach. We further evaluated the hydrological utility of different precipitation products using a distributed hydrological model for the poorly gauged headwaters of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in the TP. The MSP achieved the best Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (over 0.8) and {\textless}em{\textgreater}CC{\textless}/em{\textgreater} (over 0.9) for daily streamflow simulations during 2004–2014. In addition, the MSP performed best over the ungauged western TP based on multiple collocation evaluation. The merging method could be applicable to other data-scarce regions globally to provide high quality precipitation data for hydrological research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Gap-filling and reconstruction techniques have proven to be effective in producing serially complete station datasets (SCDs) that are used for a myriad of meteorological applications (e.g., developing gridded meteorological datasets and validating models). To our knowledge, all SCDs are developed at regional scales. In this study, we developed the serially complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which provides daily precipitation, mean temperature, temperature range, dewpoint temperature, and wind speed data from 1950 to 2019. SC-Earth utilizes raw station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily (GHCN-D) and the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). A unified station repository is generated based on GHCN-D and GSOD after station merging and strict quality control. ERA5 is optimally matched with station data considering the time shift issue and then used to assist the global gap filling. SC-Earth is generated by merging estimates from 15 strategies based on quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, machine learning, and multistrategy merging. The final estimates are bias corrected using a combination of quantile mapping and quantile delta mapping. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that SC-Earth has high accuracy around the globe, with degraded quality in the tropics and oceanic islands due to sparse station networks, strong spatial precipitation gradients, and degraded ERA5 estimates. Meanwhile, SC-Earth inherits potential limitations such as inhomogeneity and precipitation undercatch from raw station data, which may affect its application in some cases. Overall, the high-quality and high-density SC-Earth dataset will benefit research in fields of hydrology, ecology, meteorology, and climate.

The new SCD for North America (SCDNA) includes daily precipitation, minimum temperature ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}$_{\textrm{min⁡}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), and maximum temperature ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}$_{\textrm{max⁡}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) data for 27\&thinsp;276 stations. Raw meteorological station data were obtained from the Global Historical Climate Network Daily (GHCN-D), the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and a compiled station database in Mexico. Stations with at least 8-year-long records were selected, which underwent location correction and were subjected to strict quality control. Outputs from three reanalysis products (ERA5, JRA-55, and MERRA-2) provided auxiliary information to estimate station records. Infilling during the observation period and reconstruction beyond the observation period were accomplished by combining estimates from 16 strategies (variants of quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, and machine learning). A sensitivity experiment was conducted by assuming that 30\&thinsp;\% of observations from stations were missing – this enabled independent validation and provided a reference for reconstruction. Quantile mapping and mean value corrections were applied to the final estimates. The median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{′}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) values of the final SCDNA for all stations are 0.90, 0.98, and 0.99 for precipitation, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}$_{\textrm{min⁡}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}$_{\textrm{max⁡}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, respectively. The SCDNA is closer to station observations than the four benchmark gridded products and can be used in applications that require either quality-controlled meteorological station observations or reconstructed long-term estimates for analysis and modeling.

In ensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members are used to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, of a spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the available information. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications. This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America (EMDNA). EMDNA has 100 ensemble members with daily precipitation amount, mean daily temperature, and daily temperature range at 0.1{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} spatial resolution (approx. 10 km grids) from 1979 to 2018, derived from a fusion of station observations and reanalysis model outputs. The station data used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America (SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements using multiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded, corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimal interpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates. EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated random fields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) the merged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates, particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimates are more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regression estimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident in sparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performance according to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. We discuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that further research is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall, EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorological applications in North America.

	abstract = {Low accuracy and coarse spatial resolution are the two main drawbacks of satellite precipitation products. Therefore, calibration and downscaling are necessary before these products are applied. This study proposes a two-step framework to improve the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates. The first step is data merging based on optimum interpolation (OI), and the second step is downscaling based on geographically weighted regression (GWR); therefore, the framework is called OI-GWR. An Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) product is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of OI-GWR in the Tianshan Mountains, China. First, the original IMERG precipitation data (OIMERG) are merged with rain gauge data using the OI method to produce corrected IMERG precipitation data (CIMERG). Then, using CIMERG as the first guess and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the auxiliary variable, GWR is utilized for spatial downscaling. The two-step OI-GWR method is compared with several traditional methods, including GWR downscaling (Ori\_GWR) and spline interpolation. The cross-validation results show that (1) the OI method noticeably improves the accuracy of OIMERG, and (2) the 1-km downscaled data obtained using OI-GWR are much better than those obtained from Ori\_GWR, spline interpolation, and OIMERG. The proposed OI-GWR method can contribute to the development of high-resolution and high-accuracy regional precipitation datasets. However, it should be noted that the method proposed in this study cannot be applied in regions without any meteorological stations. In addition, further efforts will be needed to achieve daily- or hourly-scale downscaling of precipitation.},

The relative difference (RD) was calculated between precipitation estimates over pixels containing water bodies and over pixels neighboring water bodies. A t-test was employed to check the statistical significance. Results show that similar to 53\% of the water bodies passed the significance test at the daily scale for the TRMM products on average. Gauge adjustment alleviates the overestimation of 3B42V7 (mean RD = 20\%) compared with 3B42RT (mean RD = 34\%). Liquid water surfaces tend to affect the quality of TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis more significantly than ice water surfaces due to different passive microwave (MW) emission characteristics. In contrast, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission products provide more consistent precipitation estimates, with only similar to 4\% of the water bodies passing the significance test. TRMM-based precipitation estimates are much higher than GPM products over inland water bodies, which is, however, not the case over the land. The improvement is mainly attributed to the unified and updated MW algorithm used in GPM products.},

	abstract = {The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) produces the latest generation of satellite precipitation estimates and has been widely used since its release in 2014. IMERG V06 provides global rainfall and snowfall data beginning from 2000. This study comprehensively analyzes the quality of the IMERG product at daily and hourly scales in China from 2000 to 2018 with special attention paid to snowfall estimates. The performance of IMERG is compared with nine satellite and reanalysis products (TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP, CHIRPS, SM2RAIN, ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA2). Results show that the IMERG product outperforms other datasets, except the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), which uses daily-scale station data to adjust satellite precipitation estimates. The monthly-scale station data adjustment used by IMERG naturally has a limited impact on estimates of precipitation occurrence and intensity at the daily and hourly time scales. The quality of IMERG has improved over time, attributed to the increasing number of passive microwave samples. SM2RAIN, ERA5, and MERRA2 also exhibit increasing accuracy with time that may cause variable performance in climatological studies. Even relying on monthly station data adjustments, IMERG shows good performance in both accuracy metrics at hourly time scales and the representation of diurnal cycles. In contrast, although ERA5 is acceptable at the daily scale, it degrades at the hourly scale due to the limitation in reproducing the peak time, magnitude and variation of diurnal cycles. IMERG underestimates snowfall compared with gauge and reanalysis data. The triple collocation analysis suggests that IMERG snowfall is worse than reanalysis and gauge data, which partly results in the degraded quality of IMERG in cold climates. This study demonstrates new findings on the uncertainties of various precipitation products and identifies potential directions for algorithm improvement. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite rainfall products.},

Radars are considered the best available technology for observing the spatial distribution of precipitation either from the ground since the 1980s or from space since 1998. This study, for the first time ever, compares and evaluates the only three existing spaceborne precipitation radars, i.e., the Ku-band precipitation radar (PR), the W-band Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), and the Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The three radars are matched up globally and intercompared in the only period which they coexist: 2014-2015. In addition, for the first time ever, TRMM PR and GPM DPR are evaluated against hourly rain gauge data in Mainland China. Results show that DPR and PR agree with each other and correlate very well with gauges in Mainland China. However, both show limited performance in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole. DPR improves light precipitation detectability, when compared with PR, whereas CPR performs best for light precipitation and snowfall. DPR snowfall has the advantage of higher sampling rates than CPR; however, its accuracy needs to be improved further. The future development of spaceborne radars is also discussed in two complementary categories: (1) multifrequency radar instruments on a single platform and (2) constellations of many small cube radar satellites, for improving global precipitation estimation. This comprehensive intercomparison of PR, CPR, and DPR sheds light on spaceborne radar precipitation retrieval and future radar design.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is able to provide information on global rain and snow, but challenges remain in accurate estimation of precipitation rates, particularly in snow retrieval. In this work, the deep neural network (DNN) is applied to estimate rain and snow rates in high latitudes. The reference data for DNN training are provided by two spaceborne radars onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory and CloudSat. Passive microwave data from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), infrared data from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and environmental data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are trained to the spaceborne radar-based reference precipitation. The DNN estimates are compared to data from the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF), which is used to retrieve passive microwave precipitation for the GPM mission. First, the DNN-based retrieval method performs well in both training and testing periods. Second, the DNN can reveal the advantages and disadvantages of different channels of GMI and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Additionally, infrared and environmental data can improve precipitation estimation of the DNN, particularly for snowfall. Finally, based on the optimized DNN, rain and snow are estimated in 2017 from orbital GMI brightness temperatures and compared to ERA-Interim and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data. Evaluation results show that (1) the DNN can largely mitigate the underestimation of precipitation rates in high latitudes by GPROF; (2) the DNN-based snowfall estimates largely outperform those of GPROF; and (3) the spatial distributions of DNN-based precipitation are closer to reanalysis data. The method and assessment presented in this study could potentially contribute to the substantial improvement of satellite precipitation products in high latitudes.
Plain Language Summary Snow has a significant influence on the hydrological cycle and water resource availability. Compared to ground gauges and radars with limited coverage, satellite remote sensing can provide global rain and snow observations from space. However, traditional satellite precipitation retrieval methods are prone to errors in snow estimation at high latitudes. In this study, we developed a new rain and snow estimation method at high latitudes using deep neural networks. The reference data sets were from two spaceborne radars that provide the most direct precipitation observations from space. Passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data were trained to the reference data sets for rain and snow estimation. Results show that the neural network-based method can largely reduce the underestimation of rain and snow rates in high latitudes in many prior algorithms. Statistical indices for snow estimation are notably improved. Furthermore, combining data from passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data sets contribute to better precipitation estimation than a single source. We suggest that deep neural networks could potentially contribute to the improvement of satellite precipitation at high latitudes, which is valuable for expanding the spatial coverage of current satellite products.},

In the rainfall center, both CMORPH and PERSIANN-CCS failed to capture the temporal variation of the rainfall, and underestimated rainfall amounts by 43.43\% and 87.26\%, respectively.

	abstract = {Quantifying uncertainties of precipitation estimation, especially in extreme events, could benefit early warning of water-related hazards like flash floods and landslides. Rain gauges, weather radars, and satellites are three mainstream data sources used in measuring precipitation but have their own inherent advantages and deficiencies. With a focus on extremes, the overarching goal of this study is to cross-examine the similarities and differences of three state-of-the-art independent products (Muti-Radar Muti-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimates, MRMS; National Center for Environmental Prediction gridded gauge-only hourly precipitation product, NCEP; Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM, IMERG), with both traditional metrics and the Multiplicative Triple Collection (MTC) method during Hurricane Harvey and multiple Tropical Cyclones. The results reveal that: (a) the consistency of cross-examination results against traditional metrics approves the applicability of MTC in extreme events; (b) the consistency of cross-events of MTC evaluation results also suggests its robustness across individual storms; (c) all products demonstrate their capacity of capturing the spatial and temporal variability of the storm structures while also magnifying respective inherent deficiencies; (d) NCEP and IMERG likely underestimate while MRMS overestimates the storm total accumulation, especially for the 500-year return Hurricane Harvey; (e) both NCEP and IMERG underestimate extreme rainrates (\&gt;= 90 mm/h) likely due to device insensitivity or saturation while MRMS maintains robust across the rainrate range; (g) all three show inherent deficiencies in capturing the storm core of Harvey possibly due to device malfunctions with the NCEP gauges, relative low spatiotemporal resolution of IMERG, and the unusual \&ldquo;hot\&rdquo; MRMS radar signals. Given the unknown ground reference assumption of MTC, this study suggests that MRMS has the best overall performance. The similarities, differences, advantages, and deficiencies revealed in this study could guide the users for emergency response and motivate the community not only to improve the respective sensor/algorithm but also innovate multidata merging methods for one best possible product, specifically suitable for extreme storm events.},

This study quantitatively researched in-depth information on climate change in Jiangxi using the up-to-date “ground truth” precipitation and temperature data, the Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE, 1961–2015, 0.25°) data; analyzed the connections between ENSO and climate factors (including precipitation and temperature); and discussed the relationships between the ENSO and climate change. The main findings of this study were (1) during the period of 1961–2015, annual precipitation and temperature generally increased at a rate of 2.68 mm/year and 0.16 °C/10a, respectively; (2) the precipitation temporal trends have significant spatial differences. For example, the high precipitation increasing rates occurred in northern Jiangxi province in summer, while the large decreasing rates happened in most regions of Jiangxi province in spring; (3) an abrupt temperature change was detected around 1984, with general decreasing trends and increasing trends in 1961–1984 and 1984–2015, respectively; (4) ENSO had significant impacts on precipitation changes over Jiangxi province, for example; the El Niño events, beginning in April and May, were likely to enlarge the amounts of precipitation in the following summer, and the El Niño events beginning in October were likely to enlarge the precipitation amounts in the following spring and summer; and (5) the El Niño events, starting in the second half of the year, were likely to raise the temperature in the winter and the following spring. These findings would provide valuable information for better understanding the climate change issues over Jiangxi province.},

Near-real-time (NRT) satellite precipitation products are attractive to rainstorm monitoring and flood warning guidance owing to its combination of timeliness, high spatiotemporal resolution, and broad coverage. We evaluate the performance of four NRT satellite products, i.e., Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, 3B42RT, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) NRT, and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Late run using a high-quality merged product in the rainy June over South China. In addition, a method based on an empirical flash flood guidance and the Flash Flood Potential Index is proposed to examine the applicability of satellite products in guiding flood warning. The IMERG Late run and GSMaP NRT perform the closest-to-ground observations. 3B42RT detects the most flood warning events due to its notable overestimation of actual precipitation. We recommend that the IMERG Late run is the best NRT satellite product in capturing flood hazard events according to the Pareto Efficiency of jointly optimizing higher hit ratio and lower false alarms.},
