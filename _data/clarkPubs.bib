Results show that the snow simulations are broadly consistent with the observed snow climatology, especially with respect to estimates of snow volume and snow duration. For the parameter sets tested, snow simulations were more realistic for those for which there is strong seasonal variability in melt and where the temperature threshold for snow accumulation is set to 1°C. However, we find strong interactions among the different parameters in the snow model that cannot be resolved with the available snow data. In the short-term, detailed basin-specific studies are necessary to refine model parameter values.},

This paper reports on a non-statistical way to update the groundwater state of rainfall runoff models based on TOPMODEL concepts. The updating procedure uses measured flows and an analytical relationship between water table position and baseflow. To apply the procedure it is desirable to define periods when there is no surface runoff to the stream network. An innovative and effective model-based way to define these periods is described. By assimilating measured flow data into a TopNet flood forecasting model, the forecasts of both high and low flows are improved, with the changes in water table position being consistent with the corrections to the forecast hydrograph.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/43944886},
	abstract = {Daily rainfall data from about 200 automatic weather stations are operationally interpolated onto a regular grid of points covering all of New Zealand at a resolution of 0.05 degrees lat/long (approximately 5 km). These data, as well as daily values for 10 other climate variables, are known as NIWAs Virtual Climate Station (VCS) data. There is a need to understand the accuracy of the daily rainfall estimates, particularly for hydrological assessments. The provision of historic daily rainfall data from more than 700 Regional Council locations (many of which are no longer operational) not used in the generation of the VCS estimates, has enabled a robust error assessment. Using a regression model approach (where the VCS rainfall is the independent variable and the Regional Council rainfall is the dependent variable), bias corrections were determined and applied to every VCS daily rainfall {\textgreater} 1 mm. The bias-corrected VCS rainfall mean absolute error for locations below about 500 m elevation is approximately 2-4 mm (95\% of the range) when rain days only (VCS rainfall ≥ 1 mm) are analysed. The error (and its spatial variation) is higher in areas above 500 m elevation, at approximately 5-15 mm. For daily VCS rainfalls {\textgreater} 40 mm (heavy rain days), the errors are approximately 8-12 mm (low elevation areas) and 10-40 mm (high elevation areas), and for monthly rainfall totals the corresponding errors are approximately 10-15 mm and 10-120 mm. For some uses of daily rainfall data, the installation of good quality telemetered rain gauges is the only option. However, if gauges can't be installed or the data collection cannot be maintained long-term, then using the bias-corrected VCS rainfall data is a viable option that is often a significant improvement over using data from distant stations that may not be in the same catchment or even located in a similar climatic zone.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Weather and climate variability strongly influence the people, infrastructure, and economy of Alaska. However, the sparse observational network in Alaska limits our understanding of meteorological variability, particularly of precipitation processes that influence the hydrologic cycle. Here, a new 14-yr (September 2002–August 2016) dataset for Alaska with 4-km grid spacing is described and evaluated. The dataset, generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, is useful for gaining insight into meteorological and hydrologic processes, and provides a baseline against which to measure future environmental change. The WRF fields are evaluated at annual, seasonal, and daily time scales against observation-based gridded and station records of 2-m air temperature, precipitation, and snowfall. Pattern correlations between annual mean WRF and observation-based gridded fields are
              r
              = 0.89 for 2-m temperature,
              r
              = 0.75 for precipitation,
              r
              = 0.82 for snow-day fraction,
              r
              = 0.55 for first snow day of the season, and
              r
              = 0.71 for last snow day of the season. A shortcoming of the WRF dataset is that spring snowmelt occurs too early over a majority of the state, due partly to positive 2-m temperature biases in winter and spring. Strengths include an improved representation of the interannual variability of 2-m temperature and precipitation and accurately simulated (relative to regional station observations) winter and summer precipitation maxima. This initial evaluation suggests that the 4-km WRF climate dataset robustly simulates meteorological processes and recent climatic variability in Alaska. The dataset may be particularly useful for applications that require high-temporal-frequency weather fields, such as driving hydrologic or glacier models. Future studies will provide further insight on its ability to represent other aspects of Alaska’s climate.},

	abstract = {Land models are increasingly used and preferred in terrestrial hydrological prediction applications. One reason for selecting land models over simpler models is that their physically based backbone enables wider application under different conditions. This study evaluates the temporal variability in streamflow simulations in land models. Specifically, we evaluate how the subsurface structure and model parameters control the partitioning of water into different flow paths and the temporal variability in streamflow. Moreover, we use a suite of model diagnostics, typically not used in the land modeling community to clarify model weaknesses and identify a path toward model improvement. Our analyses show that the typical land model structure, and their functions for moisture movement between soil layers (an approximation of Richards equation), has a distinctive signature where flashy runoff is superimposed on slow recessions. This hampers the application of land models in simulating flashier basins and headwater catchments where floods are generated. We demonstrate the added value of the preferential flow in the model simulation by including macropores in both a toy model and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. We argue that including preferential flow in land models is essential to enable their use for multiple applications across a myriad of temporal and spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This paper describes ESM-SnowMIP, an international coordinated modelling
effort to evaluate current snow schemes, including snow schemes that are
included in Earth system models, in a wide variety of settings against local
and global observations. The project aims to identify crucial processes and
characteristics that need to be improved in snow models in the context of
local- and global-scale modelling. A further objective of ESM-SnowMIP is to
better quantify snow-related feedbacks in the Earth system. Although it is
not part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP6), ESM-SnowMIP is tightly linked to the CMIP6-endorsed Land Surface,
Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison (LS3MIP).},

	doi = {10.5194/hess-2020-192},
	abstract = {Abstract. Floods cause large damages, especially if they affect large regions. Assessments of current, local and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding, which is, however, not guaranteed especially when using standard model calibration metrics. In this paper we investigate how flood timing, magnitude and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling–Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance. We compare how four well-known models (SAC, HBV, VIC, and mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns; and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes. Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics is challenging. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not necessarily well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions. We conclude that models calibrated on integrated metrics such as the Kling–Gupta efficiency alone have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, in particular in regional and future assessments, and suggest the development of alternative process-based and spatial evaluation metrics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Streamflow regimes are changing and expected to further change under the influence of climate change with potential impacts on flow variability and the seasonality of extremes. However, not all types of regimes are going to change in the same way. Climate change impact assessments can therefore benefit from identifying classes of catchments with similar streamflow regimes. Traditional catchment classification approaches have focused on specific meteorological and/or streamflow indices usually neglecting the temporal information stored in the data. The aim of this study is two-fold: (1) develop a catchment classification scheme that allows for the incorporation of such temporal information and (2) use the scheme to evaluate changes in future flow regimes. We use the developed classification scheme, which relies on a functional data representation, to cluster a large set of catchments in the conterminous United States (CONUS) according to their mean annual hydrographs. We identify five regime classes that summarize the behavior of catchments in the CONUS: (1) Intermittent regime, (2) weak winter regime, (3) strong winter regime, (4) New Year's regime, and (5) melt regime. Our results show that these spatially contiguous classes are not only similar in terms of their regimes, but also their flood and drought behavior, as well as their physiographical and meteorological characteristics. We therefore deem the functional regime classes valuable for a number of applications going beyond change assessments including model validation studies or the prediction of streamflow characteristics in ungauged basins. To assess future regime changes, we use simulated discharge time series obtained from the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model driven with meteorological time series generated by five general circulation models. A comparison of the future regime classes derived from these simulations with current classes shows that robust regime changes are expected only for currently melt-influenced regions in the Rocky Mountains. These changes in mountainous, upstream regions may require the adaptation of water management strategies to ensure sufficient water supply in dependent downstream regions.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Land models are increasingly used in terrestrial hydrology due to
their process-oriented representation of water and energy fluxes. A priori
specification of the grid size of the land models is typically defined based
on the spatial resolution of forcing data, the modeling objectives, the
available geospatial information, and computational resources. The
variability of the inputs, soil types, vegetation covers, and forcing is
masked or aggregated based on the a priori grid size. In this study, we propose an
alternative vector-based implementation to directly configure a land model
using unique combinations of land cover types, soil types, and other desired
geographical features that have hydrological significance, such as elevation
zone, slope, and aspect. The main contributions of this paper are to (1) implement the vector-based spatial configuration using the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model; (2) illustrate how the spatial
configuration of the model affects simulations of basin-average quantities
(i.e., streamflow) as well as the spatial variability of internal processes
(snow water equivalent, SWE, and evapotranspiration, ET); and (3) describe the work and challenges ahead to improve the
spatial structure of land models. Our results show that a model
configuration with a lower number of computational units, once calibrated,
may have similar accuracy to model configurations with more computational
units. However, the different calibrated parameter sets produce a range of,
sometimes contradicting, internal states and fluxes. To better address the
shortcomings of the current generation of land models, we encourage the land
model community to adopt flexible spatial configurations to improve model
representations of fluxes and states at the scale of interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Hydrological models are usually systems of nonlinear differential equations for which no analytical solutions exist and thus rely on approximate numerical solutions. While some studies have investigated the relationship between numerical method choice and model error, the extent to which extreme precipitation like that observed during hurricanes Harvey and Katrina impacts numerical error of hydrological models is still unknown. This knowledge is relevant in light of climate change, where many regions will likely experience more intense precipitation events. In this experiment, a large number of hydrographs is generated with the modular modeling framework FUSE, using eight numerical techniques across a variety of forcing datasets. Multiple model structures, parameter sets, and initial conditions are incorporated for generality. The computational expense and numerical error associated with each hydrograph were recorded. It was found that numerical error (root mean square error) usually increases with precipitation intensity and decreases with event duration. Some numerical methods constrain errors much more effectively than others, sometimes by many orders of magnitude. Of the tested numerical methods, a second-order adaptive explicit method is found to be the most efficient because it has both low numerical error and low computational cost. A basic literature review indicates that many popular modeling codes use numerical techniques that were suggested by this experiment to be sub-optimal. We conclude that relatively large numerical errors might be common in current models, and because these will likely become larger as the climate changes, we advocate for the use of low cost, low error numerical methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Probabilistic methods are useful to estimate the
uncertainty in spatial meteorological fields (e.g., the uncertainty in
spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature across large domains). In
ensemble probabilistic methods, “equally plausible” ensemble members are
used to approximate the probability distribution, hence the uncertainty, of
a spatially distributed meteorological variable conditioned to the available
information. The ensemble members can be used to evaluate the impact of
uncertainties in spatial meteorological fields for a myriad of applications.
This study develops the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for North America
(EMDNA). EMDNA has 100 ensemble members with daily precipitation amount,
mean daily temperature, and daily temperature range at 0.1∘
spatial resolution (approx. 10 km grids) from 1979 to 2018, derived from a
fusion of station observations and reanalysis model outputs. The station
data used in EMDNA are from a serially complete dataset for North America
(SCDNA) that fills gaps in precipitation and temperature measurements using
multiple strategies. Outputs from three reanalysis products are regridded,
corrected, and merged using Bayesian model averaging. Optimal
interpolation (OI) is used to merge station- and reanalysis-based estimates.
EMDNA estimates are generated using spatiotemporally correlated random
fields to sample from the OI estimates. Evaluation results show that (1) the
merged reanalysis estimates outperform raw reanalysis estimates,
particularly in high latitudes and mountainous regions; (2) the OI estimates
are more accurate than the reanalysis and station-based regression
estimates, with the most notable improvements for precipitation evident in
sparsely gauged regions; and (3) EMDNA estimates exhibit good performance
according to the diagrams and metrics used for probabilistic evaluation. We
discuss the limitations of the current framework and highlight that further
research is needed to improve ensemble meteorological datasets. Overall,
EMDNA is expected to be useful for hydrological and meteorological
applications in North America. The entire dataset and a teaser dataset (a
small subset of EMDNA for easy download and preview) are available at

            Stations are an important source of meteorological data, but often suffer from missing values and short observation periods. Gap filling is widely used to generate serially complete datasets (SCDs), which are subsequently used to produce gridded meteorological estimates. However, the value of SCDs in spatial interpolation is scarcely studied. Based on our recent efforts to develop a SCD over North America (SCDNA), we explore the extent to which gap filling improves gridded precipitation and temperature estimates. We address two specific questions: (1) Can SCDNA improve the statistical accuracy of gridded estimates in North America? (2) Can SCDNA improve estimates of trends on gridded data? In addressing these questions, we also evaluate the extent to which results depend on the spatial density of the station network and the spatial interpolation methods used. Results show that the improvement in statistical interpolation due to gap filling is more obvious for precipitation, followed by minimum temperature and maximum temperature. The improvement is larger when the station network is sparse and when simpler interpolation methods are used. SCDs can also notably reduce the uncertainties in spatial interpolation. Our evaluation across North America from 1979 to 2018 demonstrates that SCDs improve the accuracy of interpolated estimates for most stations and days. SCDNA-based interpolation also obtains better trend estimation than observation-based interpolation. This occurs because stations used for interpolation could change during a specific period, causing changepoints in interpolated temperature estimates and affect the long-term trends of observation-based interpolation, which can be avoided using SCDNA. Overall, SCDs improve the performance of gridded precipitation and temperature estimates.},

            Meteorological data from ground stations suffer from temporal discontinuities caused by missing values and short measurement periods. Gap filling and reconstruction techniques have proven to be effective in producing serially complete station datasets (SCDs) that are used for a myriad of meteorological applications (e.g., developing gridded meteorological datasets and validating models). To our knowledge, all SCDs are developed at regional scales. In this study, we developed the serially complete Earth (SC-Earth) dataset, which provides daily precipitation, mean temperature, temperature range, dew-point temperature, and wind speed data from 1950 to 2019. SC-Earth utilizes raw station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). A unified station repository is generated based on GHCN-D and GSOD after station merging and strict quality control. ERA5 is optimally matched with station data considering the time shift issue and then used to assist the global gap filling. SC-Earth is generated by merging estimates from 15 strategies based on quantile mapping, spatial interpolation, machine learning, and multi-strategy merging. The final estimates are bias corrected using a combination of quantile mapping and quantile delta mapping. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that SC-Earth has high accuracy around the globe, with degraded quality in the tropics and oceanic islands due to sparse station networks, strong spatial precipitation gradients, and degraded ERA5 estimates. Meanwhile, SC-Earth inherits potential limitations such as inhomogeneity and precipitation undercatch from raw station data, which may affect its application in some cases. Overall, the high-quality and high-density SC-Earth dataset will benefit research in fields of hydrology, ecology, meteorology, and climate.},

            The intent of this paper is to encourage improved numerical implementation of land models. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a unified framework to formulate and implement land model equations. We separate the representation of physical processes from their numerical solution, enabling the use of established robust numerical methods to solve the model equations. Second, we introduce a set of synthetic test cases (the laugh tests) to evaluate the numerical implementation of land models. The test cases include storage and transmission of water in soils, lateral sub-surface flow, coupled hydrological and thermodynamic processes in snow, and cryosuction processes in soil. We consider synthetic test cases as “laugh tests” for land models because they provide the most rudimentary test of model capabilities. The laugh tests presented in this paper are all solved with the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives model (SUMMA) implemented using the SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/Algebraic equation Solvers (SUNDIALS). The numerical simulations from SUMMA/SUNDIALS are compared against (1) solutions to the synthetic test cases from other models documented in the peer-reviewed literature; (2) analytical solutions; and (3) observations made in laboratory experiments. In all cases, the numerical simulations are similar to the benchmarks, building confidence in the numerical model implementation. We posit that some land models may have difficulty in solving these benchmark problems. Dedicating more effort to solving synthetic test cases is critical in order to build confidence in the numerical implementation of land models.},

            The diurnal cycle of solar radiation represents the strongest energetic forcing and dominates the exchange of heat and mass of the land surface with the atmosphere. This diurnal heat redistribution represents a core of land–atmosphere coupling that should be accurately represented in land surface models (LSMs), which are critical parts of weather and climate models. We employ a diagnostic model evaluation approach using a signature-based metric that describes the diurnal variation of heat fluxes. The metric is obtained by decomposing the diurnal variation of surface heat fluxes into their direct response and the phase lag to incoming solar radiation. We employ the output of 13 different LSMs driven with meteorological forcing of 20 FLUXNET sites (PLUMBER dataset). All LSMs show a poor representation of the evaporative fraction and thus the diurnal magnitude of the sensible and latent heat flux under cloud-free conditions. In addition, we find that the diurnal phase of both heat fluxes is poorly represented. The best performing model only reproduces 33\% of the evaluated evaporative conditions across the sites. The poor performance of the diurnal cycle of turbulent heat exchange appears to be linked to how models solve for the surface energy balance and redistribute heat into the subsurface. We conclude that a systematic evaluation of diurnal signatures is likely to help to improve the simulated diurnal cycle, better represent land–atmosphere interactions, and therefore improve simulations of the near-surface climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Floods cause extensive damage, especially if they affect large regions. Assessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding under current and future climate conditions. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments.
This study evaluates the extent to which models calibrated according to standard model calibration metrics such as the widely used Kling–Gupta efficiency are able to capture flood spatial coherence and triggering mechanisms.
To highlight challenges related to flood simulations, we investigate how flood timing, magnitude, and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling–Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance also in flood-related studies. Specifically, we compare how four well-known models (the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, SAC; the Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning model, HBV; the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC; and the mesoscale hydrologic model, mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes.
Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics are challenging as models underestimate flood magnitude, and flood timing is not necessarily well captured. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not always well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions.
From a large sample of catchments and with multiple models, we conclude that calibration on the integrated Kling–Gupta metric alone is likely to yield models that have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, undermining their utility for regional and future change assessments. We underscore that such assessments can be improved by developing flood-focused, multi-objective, and spatial calibration metrics, by improving flood generating process representation through model structure comparisons and by considering uncertainty in precipitation input.},

            Global gridded precipitation products have proven essential for many applications ranging from hydrological modeling and climate model validation to natural hazard risk assessment. They provide a global picture of how precipitation varies across time and space, specifically in regions where ground-based observations are scarce. While the application of global precipitation products has become widespread, there is limited knowledge on how well these products represent the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation—the key features in triggering flood hazards. Here, five global precipitation datasets (MSWEP, CFSR, CPC, PERSIANN-CDR, and WFDEI) are compared to each other and to surface observations. The spatial variability of relatively high precipitation events (tail heaviness) and the resulting discrepancy among datasets in the predicted precipitation return levels were evaluated for the time period 1979–2017. The analysis shows that 1) these products do not provide a consistent representation of the behavior of extremes as quantified by the tail heaviness, 2) there is strong spatial variability in the tail index, 3) the spatial patterns of the tail heaviness generally match the Köppen–Geiger climate classification, and 4) the predicted return levels for 100 and 1000 years differ significantly among the gridded products. More generally, our findings reveal shortcomings of global precipitation products in representing extremes and highlight that there is no single global product that performs best for all regions and climates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Station-based serially complete datasets (SCDs) of precipitation and temperature observations are
important for hydrometeorological studies. Motivated by the lack of serially complete station
observations for North America, this study seeks to develop an SCD from 1979 to 2018 from station
data. The new SCD for North America (SCDNA) includes daily precipitation, minimum temperature
(Tmin⁡), and maximum temperature (Tmax⁡) data for 27 276 stations. Raw meteorological
station data were obtained from the Global Historical Climate Network Daily (GHCN-D), the Global
Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and a compiled
station database in Mexico. Stations with at least 8-year-long records were selected, which underwent
location correction and were subjected to strict quality control. Outputs from three reanalysis
products (ERA5, JRA-55, and MERRA-2) provided auxiliary information to estimate station
records. Infilling during the observation period and reconstruction beyond the observation period
were accomplished by combining estimates from 16 strategies (variants of quantile mapping, spatial
interpolation, and machine learning). A sensitivity experiment was conducted by assuming that 30 \% of
observations from stations were missing – this enabled independent validation and provided a
reference for reconstruction. Quantile mapping and mean value corrections were applied to the
final estimates. The median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE′) values of the final SCDNA for
all stations are 0.90, 0.98, and 0.99 for precipitation, Tmin⁡, and Tmax⁡,
respectively. The SCDNA is closer to station observations than the four benchmark gridded
products and can be used in applications that require either quality-controlled meteorological
station observations or reconstructed long-term estimates for analysis and modeling. The dataset
is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3735533 (Tang et al., 2020).},

InformEd Regression (TIER) model, which uses
terrain attributes in a regression framework to distribute in situ observations of
precipitation and temperature to a grid. The framework enables our
understanding of complex atmospheric processes (e.g., orographic
precipitation) to be encoded into a statistical model in an easy-to-understand
manner. TIER is developed in a modular fashion with key model
parameters exposed to the user. This enables the user community to easily
explore the impacts of our methodological choices made to distribute sparse,
irregularly spaced observations to a grid in a systematic fashion. The
modular design allows incorporating new capabilities in TIER. Intermediate
processing variables are also output to provide a more complete
understanding of the algorithm and any algorithmic changes. The framework
also provides uncertainty estimates. This paper presents a brief model
evaluation and demonstrates that the TIER algorithm is functioning as
expected. Several variations in model parameters and changes in the
distributed variables are described. A key conclusion is that seemingly
small changes in a model parameter result in large changes to the final
distributed fields and their associated uncertainty estimates.},
