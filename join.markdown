## Interested in joining the team?

We're often looking for talented people to join our team. Broadly speaking, our team focuses on designing and implementing various water resources modelling and prediction tools, assessing and improving their performance across a range of hydrological environments using in-situ and remote sensing data, benchmarking observations from research basins, running large-domain simulations on supercomputers, and working with users to improve the value of modelling and prediction products for water resources planning and management. We  work on many different aspects of hydrological science, including cold regions processes, uncertainty quantification, stochastic modelling, and water quality prediction. Much of our model development work is targeted toward applications in streamflow forecasting, water security assessments, and improving the representation of hydrological processes in Earth System models. Please feel free to browse through our website and send a targeted email to [martyn.clark@usask.ca](mailto:martyn.clark@usask.ca) if you'd like to work with us as a Masters or PhD candidate or as a postdoctoral fellow.
