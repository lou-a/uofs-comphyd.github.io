## Interested in joining the team?

We're often looking for talented people to join our team. Our group builds tools to simulate and predict hydrological processes. We span spatial scales from hillslopes to continents and time scales from seconds to centuries. Some of our example contributions include ensemble forcing data for large-domain hydrological models, multi-scale hydrological models, continental-domain network routing models, ensemble methods for data assimilation, and process-based methods for model benchmarking and model evaluation. Much of our model development work is targeted toward applications in streamflow forecasting, water security assessments, and improving the representation of hydrological processes in Earth System models. Please feel free to browse through our website and send a targeted email to [martyn.clark@usask.ca](mailto:martyn.clark@usask.ca) if you'd like to work with us as a Masters or PhD candidate or as a postdoctoral fellow.
