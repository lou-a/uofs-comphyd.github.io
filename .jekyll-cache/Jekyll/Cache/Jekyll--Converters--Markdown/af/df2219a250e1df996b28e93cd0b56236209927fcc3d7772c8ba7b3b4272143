I"<p>I like adjectives. In fact, one of the reasons I enjoy writing letters of support for my colleagues is because it gives me the opportunity to make extensive use of adjectives. I get to use words like <em>spectacular</em>, <em>inquisitive</em>, <em>unselfish</em>, and <em>revolutionary</em>. I become satisfied when my flowery language paints a portrait of my colleagues that helps them get the recognition that they deserve. Itâ€™s all about the adjectives (and my colleagues of course!).</p>

<p>I have encountered a situation, however, where the English language suffers from a shortage of adjectives. In hydrological modelling we often make the distinction between accuracy and fidelity. Accuracy is used to describe discrepancies between model simulations and observations; fidelity is used to describe the extent to which a model faithfully represents the dominant processes in the region where it is applied. Accuracy is a necessary (yet not sufficient) condition for fidelity.</p>

<p>You may now notice my conundrum: whilst the adverb <em>faithfully</em> can be adequately paired with <em>fidelity</em>, the adjectives to describe model fidelity are, arguably, inadequate. We can use the term <em>accurate</em> to describe model accuracy, but it is awkward to use the term <em>faithful</em> to describe model fidelity. The awkwardness arises because <em>faithful</em> has religious connotations, as faith may not be supported by facts.</p>

<p>An alternative can be found in Olde English. As it turns out, there is another adjective for fidelity: the (now obsolete) adjective <em>fidelious</em> (or <em>fidelitous</em>). The term <em>fidelious</em> may, for some, invoke memories of <em>Harry Potter</em> (e.g., the Fidelus charm), and this simply underscores its panache. The adjective <em>fidelious</em>, I think, has tremendous utility in the hydrological sciences.</p>

<p>I respectfully suggest, dear reader, that we introduce the age-old adjective <em>fidelious</em> into the hydrological vernacular. Our manuscripts will be all the better for it.</p>
