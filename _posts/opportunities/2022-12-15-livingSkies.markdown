We are seeking multiple highly motivated postdoctoral fellows for a new project to advance development of Coupled Human and Water Systems modeling. Successful candidates will work with an interdisciplinary team consisting of researchers from USask (Martyn Clark, Pat Lloyd-Smith, Raymond Spiteri, and Corinne Schuster-Wallace), Saskatchewan Association of Watersheds, and Alberta’s Ministry of Environment and Protected Areas. The successful candidates will work together as a team to improve our capability to simulate coupled human-water systems across spatial scales and different hydroclimate and socio-political contexts.

These are full-time 2-year positions. Candidates will work on intersecting, yet distinct objectives:
- Objective 1: Understand coupled human-water interactions across different spatial scales and different hydroclimate and political contexts;
- Objective 2: Develop a prototypical computational model to simulate coupled human-water interactions; 
- Objective 3: Apply the coupled human-water systems model to develop narratives of change that explicitly include bidirectional feedbacks.

### What you will do:

Broadly speaking, the work will focus on advancing understanding and modelling of coupled human-water systems. PDFs 1 and 2 will be hired based on deep disciplinary expertise with an interest and experience in working across disciplines (PDF1 – social sciences; PDF 2 – computer sciences / mathematics). PDF 3 will be required to demonstrate broader transdisciplinary expertise such as environmental or sustainability sciences, with experience in considering social responses or impacts.

**PDF 1** will focus on understanding coupled human-water interactions across different spatial scales and different hydroclimate and political contexts.

**PDF 2** will focus on developing a prototypical computational model to simulate coupled human-water interactions for contrasting catchments and communities across Canada.

**PDF 3** will focus on applying coupled human-water systems models to develop narratives of change that explicitly include natural feedbacks, human responses and feedbacks, and human-environment feedbacks. 

### Research environment:

We are committed to providing a safe, positive, respectful, accessible, and non-discriminatory workplace for everyone by ensuring that the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility culture thrives within our research teams. The following principles shape our research environment: Equity – the research environment is most effective if each team member has the opportunity for intellectual and personal growth; Diversity – the research environment is most effective if it includes people with different backgrounds, perspectives, and world views; Inclusion – the research environment is most effective where all team members trust each other, support each other, and work together closely to help each other succeed; Accessibility – the research environment supports programs, services, and products so they are accessible to people living with various abilities. We recognize that preferred scientific approaches may differ for individuals and institutions, and rigorous yet constructive dialog about such differences are both welcome and encouraged.

### Desired qualifications and skills:

**Postdoctoral scholars** should have a recent Ph.D. degree (0-3 years of postdoctoral experience) in water resources, water management, water-related human behaviour, hydro-economics, environmental economics, hydrology, civil engineering, geography, environmental science, earth science, computer science, data science, physics, or related discipline, and meet some of the following criteria:
- Demonstrated record of high-quality research and publication.
- In-depth knowledge related to the specific position.
- Strong competence in data preparation/analysis/visualization. 
- Experience and dedication to open science.
- Ability to communicate clearly, concisely, and effectively in both spoken and written English.
- Sharp analytical abilities and problem-solving skills.
- Demonstrated leadership abilities and record of positive contributions in a team environment.
- Ability to work with minimal supervision, multi-task, and prioritize workload.
- Interest in mentoring junior team members.
- Interest in science communication (e.g., blog posts, social media, and media interviews).

### How to apply:

If interested in these positions, please send a cover letter explaining your interests and experience as it pertains to one of the three positions, your CV, and a list of three references to Corinne Schuster-Wallace [cschuster.wallace@usask.ca](mailto:cschuster.wallace@usask.ca) before 31 January 2023 with “CHWS PDF Positions” on the subject line. Other material may be requested after applications are reviewed. The desired start date is during the period July-September 2023.
