Canmore is a small town and the distance to the mothership in Saskatoon is large. It wouldn’t be strange to assume the Coldwater Lab sees limited interaction with the larger hydrologic community. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth! Excepting the current pandemic, the Coldwater Lab is a buzzing hub of activity and provides plenty of interaction between those who work there and those fortunate enough to visit us for a while. In these times of social distancing and limited travel, we look back on the illustrious visitors to the lab in the past 9 months or so.

[Berit Arheimer](https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/hydrology/berit-arheimer-1.8007), who is currently head of the Unit for Hydrological Research at SMHI (Sweden) and president-elect of the IAHS, visited the lab in July 2019 to explore potential collaborations. 

Autumn 2019 saw a string of visitors in quick succession. [Bart Nijssen](https://www.ce.washington.edu/facultyfinder/bart-nijssen) (Univeristy of Washington, US), [Adrian Harpold](https://www.unr.edu/nres/people/harpold-adrian) (University of Nevada, US) and [David Hannah](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/hannah-david.aspx) (University of Birmingham, UK) all visited Canada as part of the University of Saskatchewan’s Distinguished Lecture Series (https://water.usask.ca/lecture-series/dls.php#2019DistinguishedLectureSeries) and found time to visit Canmore for a few days as well.  

We got to welcome three early career researchers for longer stays, two of which during autumn. [Keirnan Fowler](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/99684-keirnan-fowler) (University of Melbourne, Australia) visited for two weeks to initiate collaboration on model benchmarking. PhD candidate [Lina Stein](https://twitter.com/LiinaStein) (University of Bristol, UK) joined us for a three month research visit to investigate flood generating processes in North America. Lina’s supervisor [Ross Woods](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/ross-a-woods/overview.html) (University of Bristol, UK) visited us for a week during Lina’s research visit. 

January 2020 saw few visitors, presumably because Alberta had the doubtful honor to be one of the coldest places on the planet for a while. Things picked back up in February when [Manuela Brunner](https://twitter.com/manuelaibrunner?lang=en) (National Center for Atmospheric Research, US) joined us for a three week visit to share thoughts on dominant flood generating processes and the capabilities of current hydrologic models to represent these. Around the same time, [Dmitri Kavetski](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/dmitri.kavetski) (University of Adelaide, Australia) briefly interrupted his skiing holiday for various chats in Canmore. 

In early February, Canmore was also the home of a Global Water Futures: Core Modelling Geospatial Intelligence meeting that brought together two dozen research personnel to discuss ways to improve model workflows and code sharing, large-domain parameter estimation and model benchmarking efforts across GWF. [Luis Samaneigo](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38094) (University of Leipzig, Germany) also attended this meeting to share his insights on multiscale parameter regionalization.

We saw our last visitors in early March, when [Andy Wood](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/andywood) and [Naoki Mizukami](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/mizukami) (NCAR, US) visited us for several days of intense discussions. This visit built on the earlier work of Martyn Clark and Martyn’s work with Naoki in developing the mizuRoute routing model. mizuRoute v2 is currently being developed in a collaboration that also includes our team member Shervan Gharari.

Here’s to hoping we soon get to welcome more visitors!
