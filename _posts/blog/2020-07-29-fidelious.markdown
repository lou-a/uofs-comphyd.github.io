I like adjectives. In fact, one of the reasons I enjoy writing letters of support for my colleagues is because it gives me the opportunity to make extensive use of adjectives. I get to use words like _spectacular_, _inquisitive_, _unselfish_, and _revolutionary_. I become satisfied when my flowery language paints a portrait of my colleagues that helps them get the recognition that they deserve. Itâ€™s all about the adjectives (and my colleagues of course!).

I have encountered a situation, however, where the English language suffers from a shortage of adjectives. In hydrological modelling we often make the distinction between accuracy and fidelity. Accuracy is used to describe discrepancies between model simulations and observations; fidelity is used to describe the extent to which a model faithfully represents the dominant processes in the region where it is applied. Accuracy is a necessary (yet not sufficient) condition for fidelity.

You may now notice my conundrum: whilst the adverb _faithfully_ can be adequately paired with _fidelity_, the adjectives to describe model fidelity are, arguably, inadequate. We can use the term _accurate_ to describe model accuracy, but it is awkward to use the term _faithful_ to describe model fidelity. The awkwardness arises because _faithful_ has religious connotations, as faith may not be supported by facts.

An alternative can be found in Olde English. As it turns out, there is another adjective for fidelity: the (now obsolete) adjective _fidelious_ (or _fidelitous_). The term _fidelious_ may, for some, invoke memories of _Harry Potter_ (e.g., the Fidelus charm), and this simply underscores its panache. The adjective _fidelious_, I think, has tremendous utility in the hydrological sciences.

I respectfully suggest, dear reader, that we introduce the age-old adjective _fidelious_ into the hydrological vernacular. Our manuscripts will be all the better for it.
