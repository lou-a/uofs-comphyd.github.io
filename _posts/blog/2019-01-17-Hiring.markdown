The <span>[Centre for Hydrology](http://www.usask.ca/hydrology/) | Modeling and Prediction</span> group at the [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/) is hiring motivated graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.

Possible research opportunities include developing ensemble forcing data for large-domain hydrologic models, improving multi-scale hydrologic models, improving continental-domain network routing models, developing ensemble methods for data assimilation, and developing process-based methods for model benchmarking and model evaluation. These positions will support applications in streamflow forecasting, water security assessments, and improving the representation of hydrologic processes in Earth System models.

Please contact Prof. Martyn Clark (martyn.clark@usask.ca) for more details.
