This year, the CWRA 2022 National Conference is taking place in Canmore and online between 5-8 June 2022. Our team will be attending in-person, and presenting on a variety of topics, such as: global hydrological modeling, community hydrological modeling, Canadian river national network, ensemble data assimilation in mountainous terrain, hydrological forecasting, and simulation of glacier flow. See a list of our presentations in the table below.

We also want to thank our colleagues for helping to organize the conference. Our colleague Martyn Clark serves as the co-chair of the CWRA2022 technical committee. Paul Whitfield and Guoqiang Tang lead the conference workshops that help attendees build knowledge and expertise on water related topics. Louise Arnal leads social events. Together with Janine Hay and Wouter Knoben, they are organizing an icebreaker on Sunday evening. Louise is also organizing a series of art-science events with Megan Leung (U. Calgary) to foster art-science conversations at the conference, such as an exclusive viewing of the Virtual Water Gallery exhibition at artsPlace, and a plein air activity led by Virtual Water Gallery artists. Wouter Knoben and Caroline Aubry-Wake organize tours that help attendee explore the beauty of Canmore and surroundings. Dave Casson leads sponsoring and exhibiting activities.

We are looking forward to hearing about recent scientific research and developments and to socializing with colleagues and friends from around the world. See you!
