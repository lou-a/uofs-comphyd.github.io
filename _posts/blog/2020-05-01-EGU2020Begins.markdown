Last year we has a wonderful session at the [EGU 2019](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/30338). As lead convener, I was working closely with my colleagues Björn, Luis, Simon and Sina to organize more than 50 abstracts and 3 oral blocks. We have interesting contributions from catchment to global hydrology. From remote sensing to field observation. A good range of expertise and opinion.

This year however, things are a bit different. We are depending on a text-based system to present and convene. I was thinking to myself; "who will participate?!". But it turns out that there are much more enthusiastic scientists that I initially estimated.

This year and sitting across three time zones that are spaces 8 hours, we move on to convene our [session](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/session/35498). For the good memories, I keep looking at this picture from EGU 2019. Hope everyone from this picture is safe and happy and hope to make another photo like this next year.
