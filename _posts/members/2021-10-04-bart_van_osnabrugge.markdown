### Short Bio
Bart is a Postdoctoral Fellow with Global Water Futures, based at the University of Saskatchewan in Canmore. His post-doc has two themes: 1) computational intelligence and 2)  bringing research to practice.

Bart currently works on benchmarking SUMMA based models and to integrate benchmarking workflows as a model agnostic component. A particular interest here, is to find out how benchmarking can increase the uptake of new developments. His supervisors are Martyn Clark (Usask, computational intelligence theme) and Alain Pietroniro (University of Calgary, research to practice theme).

Bart's long term research interest is hydrological forecasting from start to finish, including end-user engagement and decision making. In this regard, Bart also maintains a one-day-a-week position with Deltares, a research institute from the Netherlands known for their widely used Delft-FEWS forecasting platform. This combination promotes applying academic research in practice.
