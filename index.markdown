The <span>[Centre for Hydrology](http://www.usask.ca/hydrology/) | Modeling and Prediction</span> group at the [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/) builds tools to simulate and predict hydrologic processes. We span spatial scales from hillslopes to continents and time scales from seconds to centuries. Some of our example contributions include ensemble forcing data for large-domain hydrologic models, multi-scale hydrologic models, continental-domain network routing models, ensemble methods for data assimilation, and process-based methods for model benchmarking and model evaluation. Much of our model development work is targeted toward applications in streamflow forecasting, water security assessments, and improving the representation of hydrologic processes in Earth System models.
